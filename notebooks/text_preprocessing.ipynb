         "And just like that... December is upon us. It's been a volatile handover from November with U.S. major indices underperforming, dragged down by steep declines for the Nasdaq. Europe's Stoxx 600 managed to hold onto gains, making November the fifth positive month in a row. But tech stocks also suffered, as concerns over AI valuations and spending plans played out across global stock markets. So what does this mean for December — can stocks stage a seasonal Santa Rally, or will it be more 'bah humbug' in the final trading month of the year?\n\nMacy's Santa Claus is greeted by traders on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., Nov. 26, 2025. Brendan Mcdermid | Reuters\n\nThe case for a Santa Rally\n\nFidelity International crunched the numbers: The FTSE 100 has delivered a positive return during December in 24 out of the last 30 years. There could be some festive cheer for the U.K. this year, with markets pricing in a 90% chance the Bank of England will cut the interest rate in December after the budget was seen as avoiding any seriously inflationary measures. It's a different picture for the European Central Bank, where markets see zero chance of a cut, but this is also seen as a positive sign as the governing council said policy is in a \"good place\" in their last set of minutes. European and Asian stocks have tracked the U.S. higher each time expectations rise for a cut at the next Federal Reserve meeting in December, with a near-83% chance of a reduction now expected by markets, according to CME Fedwatch. The central banks could help bring the festive spirit this December.\n\nThe 'bah humbug' case\n\nBut there are market forces that could leave the bulls finding a lump of coal in their stocking. The drivers behind the volatility in November have not magically disappeared, with some investors and market watchers still voicing concern over the pace of AI hyperscaler spending. Even the ECB made the usual move this week of warning that U.S. tech valuations are stretched because investors have FOMO, \"fear of missing out.\" The central bank warned of \"sharp correlated price adjustments\" as a key risk for AI-driven stocks.\n\nwatch now\n\nCrypto could also be a drag in the final month of the year. As CNBC reported last week, Compass Point predicts bitcoin will continue declining as newer investors sell the token and exchange-traded-funds tied to it. Compass also suggests long-term holders could sell down their holdings due to the \"halving\" schedule, which happens every four years and \"programmatically cuts in half the amount of rewards individuals get for mining new tokens on the bitcoin blockchain.\" Why the pressure on bitcoin may linger into year-end Whether you believe in the Santa Rally or not, December will cap a fascinating year for asset classes across the globe, and make 2026 predictions tough to call.\n\nGlobal events in December:"

         "And just like that... December is upon us. It's been a volatile handover from November with U.S. major indices underperforming, dragged down by steep declines for the Nasdaq. Europe's Stoxx 600 managed to hold onto gains, making November the fifth positive month in a row. But tech stocks also suffered, as concerns over AI valuations and spending plans played out across global stock markets. So what does this mean for December — can stocks stage a seasonal Santa Rally, or will it be more 'bah humbug' in the final trading month of the year?\n\nMacy's Santa Claus is greeted by traders on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., Nov. 26, 2025. Brendan Mcdermid | Reuters\n\nThe case for a Santa Rally\n\nFidelity International crunched the numbers: The FTSE 100 has delivered a positive return during December in 24 out of the last 30 years. There could be some festive cheer for the U.K. this year, with markets pricing in a 90% chance the Bank of England will cut the interest rate in December after the budget was seen as avoiding any seriously inflationary measures. It's a different picture for the European Central Bank, where markets see zero chance of a cut, but this is also seen as a positive sign as the governing council said policy is in a \"good place\" in their last set of minutes. European and Asian stocks have tracked the U.S. higher each time expectations rise for a cut at the next Federal Reserve meeting in December, with a near-83% chance of a reduction now expected by markets, according to CME Fedwatch. The central banks could help bring the festive spirit this December.\n\nThe 'bah humbug' case\n\nBut there are market forces that could leave the bulls finding a lump of coal in their stocking. The drivers behind the volatility in November have not magically disappeared, with some investors and market watchers still voicing concern over the pace of AI hyperscaler spending. Even the ECB made the usual move this week of warning that U.S. tech valuations are stretched because investors have FOMO, \"fear of missing out.\" The central bank warned of \"sharp correlated price adjustments\" as a key risk for AI-driven stocks.\n\nwatch now\n\nCrypto could also be a drag in the final month of the year. As CNBC reported last week, Compass Point predicts bitcoin will continue declining as newer investors sell the token and exchange-traded-funds tied to it. Compass also suggests long-term holders could sell down their holdings due to the \"halving\" schedule, which happens every four years and \"programmatically cuts in half the amount of rewards individuals get for mining new tokens on the bitcoin blockchain.\" Why the pressure on bitcoin may linger into year-end Whether you believe in the Santa Rally or not, December will cap a fascinating year for asset classes across the globe, and make 2026 predictions tough to call.\n\nGlobal events in December:"

U.S. equities posted broad gains in a holiday-shortened week, supported by softer economic data and dovish messaging from Federal Reserve officials. The markets have priced an 86% probability of a 25 bps rate cut by the Fed at its December 10th meeting. Small caps outpaced large caps, and technology shares rebounded strongly.\n\nThe standout move came from silver, which surged 13%, a move reflecting both inflation concerns and increased demand for safe-haven or alternative assets.\n\nEuropean markets also strengthened, with a notable rally in bank stocks. Meanwhile, volatility dropped substantially, creating a supportive backdrop for equities and credit.\n\nUNITED STATES\n\nEquities & Markets\n\nMajor indices posted weekly gains: Dow: +3.18% S&P 500: +3.73% Nasdaq: +4.91%\n\nThe Russell 2000, a gauge of smaller companies, rose 5.52%, reflecting a shift toward risk-on sentiment.\n\nEconomic Data\n\nRetail sales: +0.2% for September, below expectations.\n\n+0.2% for September, below expectations.

Consumer confidence: Fell to 88.7, signaling growing economic caution.\n\nPolicy & Rates\n\nFed Beige Book: Employment edged lower. Prices continued moderate increases. Consumer spending weakened further.\n\nTreasury market: Yields fell as investors priced in a likely December rate cut.

Germany’s business sentiment weakened, while consumer willingness to buy improved.\n\nJAPAN\n\nJapanese markets rallied strongly:\n\nNikkei: +3.35%\n\nTOPIX: +2.45%\n\nMomentum was fueled by dovish signals about global monetary policy, a rebound in tech/AI shares, and steady Tokyo inflation at 2.8%, reinforcing speculation that the Bank of Japan may contemplate a future rate hike.\n\nThe 10-year JGB yield rose to 1.82%, approaching levels last seen 17 years ago.\n\nCHINA\n\nChinese equity benchmarks advanced:\n\nCSI 300: +1.64%\n\nShanghai Composite: +1.40%\n\nHang Seng: +2.53%\n\nDespite these gains, industrial profits fell 5.5% year over year, indicating slowing momentum and highlighting persistent structural challenges—particularly within manufacturing and real estate.\n\nOTHER KEY MARKETS/GEOPOLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nRussia–Ukraine Peace Framework Discussions\n\nA 28-point U.S. proposal has gained traction among NATO and EU members, offering a potential basis for negotiations but still requiring major concessions from both sides.\n\nSouth Korea Monetary Policy\n\nThe Bank of Korea kept the Base Rate at 2.50%, noting rising inflation but maintaining flexibility for future cuts amid global uncertainty.\n\nMARKET VOLATILITY TRENDS\n\nThe VIX dropped sharply to 16, falling 7 points in one week.\n\nThis move signals:\n\nDeclining hedging costs\n\nRenewed appetite for equities and credit\n\nPossible overconfidence if economic data fails to stabilize\n\nThe drop in volatility was one of the most influential forces shaping global risk sentiment the past and upcoming week.\n\nPRECIOUS METALS: SILVER’S POWERFUL SURGE\n\nSilver’s 13% weekly rally has pushed its year-to-date gain beyond 90%, dramatically surpassing Bitcoin’s –3% performance.\n\nKey catalysts include:\n\nStrong industrial demand\n\nElevated geopolitical tensions\n\nA softer U.S. dollar\n\nGrowing investor preference for tangible, inflation-resistant assets\n\nEUROPEAN FINANCIAL SECTOR: BANKS BREAK OUT\n\n\n\nEurozone banks delivered another standout performance this week.\n\nTheir strong gains reflect:\n\nStabilizing macroeconomic conditions\n\nAttractive valuations\n\nPositive earnings momentum\n\nEnhanced foreign interest due to currency strength\n\nThis sector remains a cornerstone of the European equity story in 2024.\n\nOUTLOOK: WHAT TO WATCH NEXT"

U.S. equities posted broad gains in a holiday-shortened week, supported by softer economic data and dovish messaging from Federal Reserve officials. The markets have priced an 86% probability of a 25 bps rate cut by the Fed at its December 10th meeting. Small caps outpaced large caps, and technology shares rebounded strongly.\n\nThe standout move came from silver, which surged 13%, a move reflecting both inflation concerns and increased demand for safe-haven or alternative assets.\n\nEuropean markets also strengthened, with a notable rally in bank stocks. Meanwhile, volatility dropped substantially, creating a supportive backdrop for equities and credit.\n\nUNITED STATES\n\nEquities & Markets\n\nMajor indices posted weekly gains: Dow: +3.18% S&P 500: +3.73% Nasdaq: +4.91%\n\nThe Russell 2000, a gauge of smaller companies, rose 5.52%, reflecting a shift toward risk-on sentiment.\n\nEconomic Data\n\nRetail sales: +0.2% for September, below expectations.\n\n+0.2% for September, below expectations. PPI: +0.3% headline; +0.1% core.\n\n+0.3% headline; +0.1% core. Jobless claims: Declined to 216,000 , the lowest since April.\n\nDeclined to , the lowest since April. Consumer confidence: Fell to 88.7, signaling growing economic caution.\n\nPolicy & Rates\n\nFed Beige Book: Employment edged lower. Prices continued moderate increases. Consumer spending weakened further.\n\nTreasury market: Yields fell as investors priced in a likely December rate cut. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell 5 bps to 4.02%\n\nEUROPE\n\nEquities\n\nSTOXX Europe 600: +2.35%\n\nDAX: +3.23%\n\nCAC 40: +1.75%\n\nFTSE 100: +1.90%\n\nEurozone Banks: Weekly and Year-to-Date Standouts\n\nBanks in Europe rallied roughly 5% for the week and are now nearly 70% higher year-to-date when currency gains are factored in. We doubt anyone believed at the beginning Euro banks would outperform Nvidia by a factor of 2x by December 1st.\n\nKey drivers included:\n\nHigher net interest margins\n\nStrong capital positions\n\nStable inflation near ECB target\n\nImproved sentiment toward European financials\n\nMacro Developments\n\nInflation across major eurozone countries remained subdued.\n\nUK’s new budget introduced £ 26 bn in tax increases.\n\nin tax increases. Germany’s business sentiment weakened, while consumer willingness to buy improved.\n\nJAPAN\n\nJapanese markets rallied strongly:\n\nNikkei: +3.35%\n\nTOPIX: +2.45%\n\nMomentum was fueled by dovish signals about global monetary policy, a rebound in tech/AI shares, and steady Tokyo inflation at 2.8%, reinforcing speculation that the Bank of Japan may contemplate a future rate hike.\n\nThe 10-year JGB yield rose to 1.82%, approaching levels last seen 17 years ago.\n\nCHINA\n\nChinese equity benchmarks advanced:\n\nCSI 300: +1.64%\n\nShanghai Composite: +1.40%\n\nHang Seng: +2.53%\n\nDespite these gains, industrial profits fell 5.5% year over year, indicating slowing momentum and highlighting persistent structural challenges—particularly within manufacturing and real estate.\n\nOTHER KEY MARKETS/GEOPOLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nRussia–Ukraine Peace Framework Discussions\n\nA 28-point U.S. proposal has gained traction among NATO and EU members, offering a potential basis for negotiations but still requiring major concessions from both sides.\n\nSouth Korea Monetary Policy\n\nThe Bank of Korea kept the Base Rate at 2.50%, noting rising inflation but maintaining flexibility for future cuts amid global uncertainty.\n\nMARKET VOLATILITY TRENDS\n\nThe VIX dropped sharply to 16, falling 7 points in one week.\n\nThis move signals:\n\nDeclining hedging costs\n\nRenewed appetite for equities and credit\n\nPossible overconfidence if economic data fails to stabilize\n\nThe drop in volatility was one of the most influential forces shaping global risk sentiment the past and upcoming week.\n\nPRECIOUS METALS: SILVER’S POWERFUL SURGE\n\nSilver’s 13% weekly rally has pushed its year-to-date gain beyond 90%, dramatically surpassing Bitcoin’s –3% performance.\n\nKey catalysts include:\n\nStrong industrial demand\n\nElevated geopolitical tensions\n\nA softer U.S. dollar\n\nGrowing investor preference for tangible, inflation-resistant assets\n\nEUROPEAN FINANCIAL SECTOR: BANKS BREAK OUT\n\n\n\nEurozone banks delivered another standout performance this week.\n\nTheir strong gains reflect:\n\nStabilizing macroeconomic conditions\n\nAttractive valuations\n\nPositive earnings momentum\n\nEnhanced foreign interest due to currency strength\n\nThis sector remains a cornerstone of the European equity story in 2024.\n\nOUTLOOK: WHAT TO WATCH NEXT"

         "Xreal One Pro ZDNET's key takeaways The Xreal One Pro is available for $599 for a limited time.\n\nThanks to the X1 chip, no special software is required for advanced functionality, the FOV is the best available, the glasses are comfortable, and the display is bright and clear.\n\nThe glasses are rather expensive, and two sizes for your eye width make them fit best for individuals. $599 at Amazon\n\nFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\n\nFor the past several months, I have been wearing the Xreal One Pro on the airplane, in an automobile, on the couch, and in my home office for media, gaming, and work. Powered by Xreal's X1 spatial computing chip for augmented reality applications, it's safe to say that the Xreal glasses have spoiled me.\n\nAlso: Best Black Friday smart glasses deals 2025: I found the biggest sales like Meta Ray-Bans for 20% off\n\nWhile XR glasses are fantastic for watching movies on the airplane and playing Nintendo Switch games on a virtual big screen, I cannot begin to express the utility I have experienced using the Xreal One Pro for getting work done on my Surface Pro and MacBook Pro computers in ultra-wide mode.\n\nUsing these glasses is better than using the three monitors I connect to in my office, and I can get that multitasking experience through a simple USB-C cable and the glasses.\n\nThe Xreal One Pro delivers an impressive visual experience, thanks to its new flat prism optics. While the design adds some bulk and weight, it enables a 57-degree field of view -- currently the widest available in any consumer AR device. For frequent flyers or daily commuters like myself, XR glasses like these offer one of the most immersive ways to watch content or play mobile games on the go.\n\nMatthew Miller/ZDNET\n\nThe audio through the glasses was developed in partnership with Bose, which I can attest provides an enjoyable audio experience even though the speakers aren't directly in your ears like traditional earbuds and headphones.\n\nAlso: I tried smart glasses with a built-in display, and they beat my Meta Ray-Bans in key ways\n\nI prefer this setup for commuting by train -- nearby passengers aren't disturbed by the audio. On a plane, though, noise-canceling headphones are essential to block out ambient noise.\n\nMatthew Miller/ZDNET\n\nI've praised the SpaceWalker app for enhancing productivity when using Viture XR glasses with a Windows or macOS computer. In contrast, Xreal's X1 chip eliminates the need for additional software, offering full functionality out of the box. The result is a more seamless, accessible XR experience that raises the bar for everyday usability.\n\nThe Xreal One Pro offers built-in ultra-wide screen functionality, and when paired with the Xreal Eye accessory, it adds 6DoF support -- letting you anchor your virtual workspace much like you can with the Apple Vision Pro or Meta Quest 3. When ultra-wide mode is enabled, all previously arranged apps, tabs, and windows reappear exactly where you left them, making for a remarkably fluid multitasking experience.\n\nAlso: I biked with the Meta Oakley Vanguard, and they're easily the best smart glasses for athletes\n\nFor frequent travelers who rely on a single laptop screen, XR glasses like these offer a compelling productivity boost -- at a fraction of the cost of multiple physical monitors. From what I've seen, with the X1 chip and these new features, Xreal sets a new benchmark for portable extended reality.\n\nMatthew Miller/ZDNET\n\nControlling XR glasses can often feel unintuitive, with some models requiring adjustments on the connected device. The Xreal One Pro simplifies this: a press of the front right button toggles between anchor and follow modes -- useful for stabilizing the display and reducing motion blur as you move your head.\n\nDouble-pressing the same button brings up on-screen menus, which you can navigate using the volume buttons. From there, adjusting screen size and distance is quick and straightforward, offering a highly customizable and immersive visual experience.\n\nAlso: Should you buy the new Meta Ray-Bans? I tested every model, and here's how to decide\n\nThe top button on the right side lets you cycle through lens transparency modes -- clear, shaded, and theater -- so you can seamlessly interact with your surroundings or switch to a 222-inch virtual display. When paired with the $99 Xreal Eye accessory, pressing and holding this button also allows you to capture photos and videos hands-free.\n\nOne reason I like the Viture Pro XR glasses is the diopter adjustment dials, but after reading more about the comparison between diopter adjustment and lens inserts, it is time for me to pick up lens inserts for those limited times I take out my contacts. The one limitation with lens inserts is that they are specific to each person, so sharing the glasses with others isn't as easy. Then again, once you have lens inserts, you no longer need to spin the dial to try to find an acceptable level.\n\nMatthew Miller\n\nThe optional Xreal Eye accessory provides the 6DoF functionality with the camera module easily fitting above the nose pads. The Eye can be used to capture photos and videos, but I haven't yet figured out a practical use case for this capability.\n\nAlso: I tried the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, and they got me excited for the post-smartphone era\n\nThe Eye can also be used to capture AR photos and videos when you connect the Xreal One Pro to an Xreal Beam Pro device. Xreal also stated that it will continue to work on functions for the Eye, to include gesture support.\n\nZDNET's buying advice\n\nThe Xreal One Pro has three sizes of nose pads, and I wore them for eight hours one day with zero discomfort. The 87-gram weight and three-point adjustable temple angles also help ensure a perfect fit for all users.\n\nIf you are looking for the best XR glasses available and want to enjoy an extreme level of productivity and media enjoyment on the go, then you can't beat the Xreal One Pro.\n\nHow it compares\n\n\n\nXreal One Pro Xreal One Display Sony 0.55\" Micro-OLED Sony 0.68\" Micro-OLED FOV 57 degrees 50 degrees Chipset Xreal X1 Chip Xreal X1 Chip 6DOF 6 DoF support with eye tracker n/a Optical design Optic Engine 4.0 Optic Engine 3.0 Brightness 700 nits 600 nits Price $649 $499\n\nUpdate log:\n\nNovember 25, 2025: After several months of testing, this review was updated and thoroughly fact-checked to reflect its market positioning.

         "Global airlines rushed to address a software glitch on Airbus A320 jets on Saturday as a partial recall by Airbus halted hundreds of flights in Asia and Europe and threatened US travel during the busiest weekend of the year.\n\nMany airlines warned of delays and cancellations following an alert from Airbus, which suggested that up to 6,000 active A320 aircraft might require upgrades due to a software glitch.\n\nIs the Airbus software glitch fixed? Are the planes operational? According to a report by Reuters, airlines worked through the night after global regulators instructed them to rectify the issue before resuming flights. Several carriers, including United Airlines, Air India, Delta Air Lines, and Hungary’s Wizz Air, said on Saturday that they had finished or nearly completed the fix to their fleets. Many reported no impact on operations.\n\nLess than 24 hours after Airbus issued the alert, carriers including American Airlines, IndiGo, and easyJet Plc, the largest operators of the A320, had reverted to a previous version of the software for most of their fleets, enabling them to maintain largely normal operations, Bloomberg reported.\n\nMeanwhile, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) announced on Sunday that Indian airlines have finished upgrading the software on 323 operational A320 aircrafts, PTI reported.\n\nAlso Read | Global airlines race to fix jets as Airbus apologises following A320 recall\n\nAmerican Airlines announced on Saturday that only four of its 209 affected aircraft still need maintenance. Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines Inc. and United Airlines Inc. stated separately that the A320 software issue had no impact on their operations.\n\nIndiGo has informed of the completion of a mandatory Airbus system upgrade across its entire A320-family fleet, confirming that all 200 aircraft are now fully compliant with the latest safety requirements. Meanwhile, Air India has successfully completed the reset on over 90% of its operating A320 family aircraft that required an update, the airline said in a post on X.\n\nSteven Greenway, CEO of Saudi carrier Flyadeal, mentioned that the recall occurred late in the evening, preventing more severe disruptions. The airline stated that it had repaired all 13 affected jets and planned to resume normal operations by midnight.\n\nHungarian discount airline Wizz Air Holdings Plc, with a fleet of around 250 Airbus aircraft, said that it completed the upgrades on all impacted Airbus A320 family planes overnight. Flight operations have now returned to normal.\n\nAlso Read | DGCA asks airlines not to operate certain Airbus models after software fix\n\nWhat should travellers expect? Amid high demand due to the Thanksgiving holiday period, US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that impacted American carriers “have reported great progress, and are on track to meet the deadline of this Sunday at midnight to complete the work.”\n\n“Travellers SHOULD NOT expect any major disruptions,” Duffy said in a post on X, adding that all affected US airlines are on schedule to finish the required aircraft work by the Sunday midnight deadline.\n\nWhat is the Airbus software issue? On Friday, Airbus announced that high levels of solar radiation could corrupt essential flight control data in many A320 family aircraft. Implementing the necessary software updates to fix this issue was expected to cause operational disruptions.\n\nThe update mainly involves reverting to earlier software versions, and aircraft must undergo this change before being cleared to fly again, according to an airline bulletin reviewed by Reuters. Several airlines cautioned that completing these repairs might cause delays or cancellations.\n\nAircraft that require the fix must revert to the previous software version, and data upload is likely to take as little as 2 to 3 hours. However, up to 1,000 older jets required a physical hardware upgrade and were grounded during the maintenance period, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the development.\n\nFriday's alert came after an unintended loss of altitude on a JetBlue flight from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, on October 30. This incident resulted in injuries to 10 passengers, and France's BEA accident agency is investigating, according to multiple reports.\n\nAirbus CEO Guillaume Faury apologised to airlines and passengers after the unexpected recall.\n\n\"I want to sincerely apologise to our airline customers and passengers who are impacted now,\" Faury posted on LinkedIn.\n\nHow many aircrafts were impacted? The European manufacturer reported that more than 6,000 aircraft were affected by the glitch, accounting for more than half of the worldwide A320 fleet, potentially risking data corruption vital for flight control systems under specific conditions."

         "RMD share price in focus\n\nTheshare price is up 6.33% since the beginning of 2025. So, how can you put a value on the RMD share price?\n\n<span data-mce-type='bookmark' style='display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;' class='mce_SELRES_start'></span><span data-mce-type='bookmark' style='display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;' class='mce_SELRES_start'></span> ResMed is a medical equipment company based in San Diego, California, but originally founded in Australia by Peter Farrell. The company provides cloud-connectable continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machines for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). ResMed shares are listed both on the NYSE and the ASX. Because the primary listing is in the US, the market announcements and reports might look a bit different to other Australian companies as they follow the US format.\n\nResMed is a global company with 10,000+ employees and a presence in over 140 countries. It has two primary business units: Sleep and Respiratory Care, and Software as a Service (SaaS). The industry-leading CPAP machines for sleep apnea are provided under the Sleep and Respiratory Care business. This covers patients ranging from those who only require therapy from CPAP systems at night to those who are dependent on non-invasive or invasive ventilation for life-support. Within the SaaS unit ResMed provides software used in durable or home medical equipment (DME/HME). Basically, it assists in out-of-hospital care.\n\nResMed leverages its industry-leading hardware (e.g. masks and humidifiers) and its SaaS data to drive insights, improve outcomes and reduce overall healthcare costs.\n\nThe key metrics\n\nIf you’ve ever tried reading a company’s income statement on the annual report, you’ll know just how complex it can get. While there are any number of ways you could slice up the statement, three key figures are revenue, gross margin, and profit.\n\nRevenue is important for obvious reasons – everything else (profit, margins, return on equity etc.) is downstream of a company’s ability to generate sales and revenue. What we’re looking for is not so much the absolute number, but the trend. RMD last reported an annual revenue of $4,685m with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the last 3 years of 13.6% per year.\n\nThe next thing we’ll want to consider is the gross margin. The gross margin tells us how profitable the core products/services are – before you take into account all the overhead costs, how much money does the company make from selling $100 worth of goods and services? RMD’s latest reported gross margin was 57.4%.\n\nFinally, we get to profit, the real headline number. Last financial year Resmed CDI reported a profit of $1,021m. That compares to 3 years ago when they made a profit of $475m, representing a CAGR of 29.1%.\n\nFinancial health of RMD shares\n\nNext, we could consider the capital health of the company. What we’re trying to work out is whether the company is generating a reasonable return on their equity (the total shareholder value) and whether they have a good safety buffer. One important measure to consider is net debt. This is simply the total debt minus the company’s cash holdings.\n\nIn the case of RMD, the current net debt sits at -$624m. A high number here means that a company has a lot of debt which potentially means higher interest payments, greater instability, and higher sensitivity to interest rates. A negative value on the other hand indicates the company has more cash than debt, which can be seen as good (a big safety buffer) or bad (inefficient capital allocation).\n\nA metric that might be more valuable to us is the debt/equity percentage. This tells us how much debt the company has relative to shareholder ownership. In other words, how leveraged is the company? Resmed CDI has a debt/equity ratio of 18.0%, which means they have more equity than debt.\n\nFinally, we can look at the return on equity (ROE). The ROE tells us how much profit a company is generating as a percentage of its total equity – high numbers indicate the company is allocating capital efficiently and generating value, while a low number suggests that company growth may be starting to slow. RMD generated an ROE of 22.7% in FY24.\n\nWhat to make of RMD shares?\n\nAs a growth company, one way to put a general prediction on the RMD share price could be to compare its price-to-sales multiple over time. Currently, Resmed CDI shares have a price-sales ratio of 5.32x, compared to its 5-year average of 8.70x, meaning its shares are trading below their historical average. This could mean that the share price has fallen, or sales have increased, or both. In the case of RMD, revenue has been growing over the last 3 years. Please keep in mind that context is important – and this is just one valuation technique. Investment decisions can’t just be based on one metric.\n\nThe Rask websites offer free online investing courses, created by analysts explaining things like Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). They even include free valuation spreadsheets! Both of these models would be a better way to value the RMD share price."

The U.S. job market is showing evolving dynamics, with a growing sailor shortage in maritime industries and new research indicating that a college degree no longer guarantees faster job placement for young adults.\n\nGlobal Market Outlook: India Poised for Recovery, China Faces Headwinds\n\nMajor Wall Street institutions are forecasting a significant turnaround for Indian markets in the coming year, following a period of underperformance in 2025. Firms including Morgan Stanley (MS), Citigroup Inc. (C), and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) anticipate a recovery driven by stabilizing corporate earnings, robust policy support, and increased domestic investment. Morgan Stanley (MS) has even sharpened its outlook, projecting the Sensex could reach 107,000 by December 2026 in a bull-case scenario. Goldman Sachs (GS) further emphasizes the potential, expecting emerging markets, particularly India, to deliver 10.9% annualized returns over the next decade, with India leading at a 13% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). This optimistic view is underpinned by India's burgeoning consumer class and its growing role as a global back office and factory.\n\nIn contrast, China's economic slowdown continues to deepen, with factory activity remaining in contraction for the eighth consecutive month in November. The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) registered 49.2, a slight improvement from October's 49.0 but still below the 50-point threshold that separates growth from contraction. This record streak of declines highlights persistent challenges for manufacturers, including difficulties in sustaining post-COVID recovery, the ongoing trade war with the U.S., a global economic slowdown, a protracted property crisis, and mounting local government debt. Adding to the concerns, the non-manufacturing PMI, which includes services and construction, also cooled, falling to 49.5 from 50.1 in October, marking its first contraction since December 2022.\n\nCurrency Volatility and Crypto's Ascent\n\nThe Japanese Yen has been a focal point of currency markets, with Japan’s Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama stating it is \"clear\" the yen's recent swings are not moving based on fundamentals. Katayama expressed \"a high sense of urgency\" regarding the \"one-sided, rapid moves\" of the yen, which recently touched an eight-month low of 154.48 against the U.S. dollar. This weakness is largely attributed to the Bank of Japan's continued ultra-loose monetary policy and the new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's pro-stimulus stance, which has introduced a $135 billion package, raising concerns about increased debt load and delayed monetary tightening. Japanese officials are closely monitoring the situation and have indicated a readiness to take appropriate action if disorderly market behavior persists.\n\nIn the cryptocurrency space, BlackRock (BLK) has made a groundbreaking announcement, declaring its Bitcoin ETFs as its top source of revenue. The firm's U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), launched in January 2024, rapidly accumulated $70 billion in assets and generated hundreds of millions in fees. This development underscores the growing dominance of cryptocurrency in traditional finance and the increasing institutional embrace of digital assets. While Bitcoin was consolidating around $90,000 in late November 2025, BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF did experience $2.35 billion in withdrawals this month, the largest outflow since its inception, prompting questions about market confidence. Despite this, BlackRock (BLK) remains the only ETF issuer to report net positive inflows for 2025, according to K33 Research, highlighting its significant influence in the crypto market.\n\nU.S. Economic and Social Trends: Mortgages, Labor, and Estate Planning\n\nIn the U.S., homeowners are actively taking advantage of dipping interest rates to refinance their mortgages. Mortgage rates have recently hovered near three-year lows, presenting a significant opportunity for many, especially those who locked in higher rates in 2023-2024. Experts predict 30-year fixed rates could settle between 6.1% and 6.3% by the end of November 2025. Refinancing applications have seen a 19% increase from the prior year. However, the market presents potential risks, as experts caution that if economic data heats up, rates could rebound, potentially making current refinancing opportunities costly in the long run.\n\nThe U.S. labor market is undergoing notable shifts. The nation faces a growing sailor shortage despite maritime jobs offering substantial pay, with some positions providing up to $100,000 a year in the first year out of school, along with significant perks. This shortage is partly attributed to a wave of senior officer retirements during the pandemic, creating a void in entry-level positions within the U.S. Merchant Marine, which currently accounts for less than 1% of global commercial ships. Concurrently, new research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland indicates that for individuals in their twenties, a college degree no longer helps them find a job faster. The job-finding rate for young college graduates has declined to align with that of high-school-educated peers, a trend influenced by a slowdown in white-collar hiring and increasing investments in artificial intelligence (AI). The unemployment rate for 22 to 27-year-old college graduates has reached its highest point since 2012, excluding the pandemic, surpassing the national average by the widest margin in over three decades.\n\nMeanwhile, a new generation of investors is emerging, with teenagers diving into stock markets, often encouraged by parents who regret not starting their own investing journeys earlier. This trend suggests a growing emphasis on early financial literacy and wealth building. On a more complex social and financial note, the widespread use of DNA test kits is causing unforeseen challenges for families settling estates, as surprise heirs are emerging and creating chaos in inheritance processes. These unexpected biological relatives can become unintended heirs, particularly in cases of intestacy or wills with broad class language, leading to protracted legal disputes even years after estates have been settled.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

Is it time that you added COH shares to your watchlist?\n\nCochlear, established in 1981 in Sydney, is a leading medical device company specializing in hearing solutions. The company designs, manufactures, and distributes three types of hearing implants tailored to various medical needs.\n\nAs a global leader in hearing technology, Cochlear has delivered over 750,000 implantable devices and employs more than 5,000 people across 50+ countries.\n\nIts mission is to enhance the quality of life for individuals living with hearing-related conditions.\n\nThe appeal of ASX Healthcare shares\n\nThe S&P/ASX200 Healthcare Index (ASX: XHJ) has returned -3.96% per year over the last 5 years compared to 5.51% per year from the broader ASX 200. Here are three key reasons to consider adding a healthcare company like COH to your investing watchlist.\n\nSticky revenue\n\nHealthcare spending (in most cases) is essential spending, making it one of the last areas people cut back on during tough economic times.\n\nUnlike cyclical businesses affected by commodity prices or seasonal demand, healthcare companies benefit from stable and consistent revenue streams. We sometimes call this ‘sticky’ revenue. Evidence of this fact is that healthcare was the best performing sector during the GFC.\n\nGrowth potential\n\nGlobal healthcare spending, particularly in the US – which accounts for over 40% of the global total – is projected to grow significantly. Estimates for US growth are 7% per year from 2022 to 2027, reaching US$819 billion.\n\nWithin the broad sector of healthcare, certain sub-sectors stand out for their additional growth potential. For example, healthcare IT, data solutions, and ‘software-as-a-service’ (or SaaS) companies are forecast to grow their revenue at more than 15% per year from 2024 to 2030, a rate that would get most investors interested.\n\nThe ethical investor\n\nA recent Morgan Stanley survey revealed that more than half of investors plan to increase their allocation to sustainable investments in 2024. With growing interest in ‘ethical’ and ‘sustainable’ investing, sectors like healthcare that provide essential public services are well-positioned to attract new capital and investors.\n\nCOH share price valuation\n\nAs a growth company, one way to put a broad estimate on the COH share price could be to compare its price-to-sales multiple over time. Currently, Cochlear Ltd shares have a price-sales ratio of 8.16x, compared to its 5-year average of 9.18x, meaning its shares are trading below their historical average. This could mean that the share price has fallen, or sales have increased. In the case of COH, revenue has been growing over the last 3 years.\n\nPlease keep in mind that context is important – and this is just one valuation technique. Investment decisions can’t just be based on one metric.\n\nThe Rask websites offer free online investing courses, created by analysts explaining things like Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). They even include free valuation spreadsheets! Both of these models would be a better way to value the COH share price."

         "Trying to make a estimate of the ASX: BEN ) share price? Here are a few factors you should be looking at.\n\nBendigo and Adelaide Bank, most commonly referred to as Bendigo Bank, was formed following the merger of the Bendigo and Adelaide Banks in November 2007 (right at the peak of credit markets!). BEN operates primarily within the retail banking space via a network of more than 500 ‘community branches’ and agencies. These are commonly found along the East Coast and South Australia.\n\nBEN share price\n\n<span data-mce-type='bookmark' style='display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;' class='mce_SELRES_start'></span>\n\nHR matters\n\nFor long-term investors looking to invest in great companies and hold them for 5, 10 or 20 years, at Rask we think it’s fair to say that a good workplace and staff culture can lead to improved retention of high-quality personnel and, in turn, long-term financial success of a company.\n\nOne way Aussie investors can get under the hood of a company like Bendigo & Adelaide Bank Ltd or Macquarie Group Ltd (ASX: MQG) is to use a HR/jobs website such as Seek. Seek’s website includes data on the culture of companies, including things like employee reviews. According to the most recent data we pulled on BEN, for example, the company’s overall workplace culture rating of 2.9/5 was less than the sector average of 3.1.\n\nBEN’s profits on loans\n\nASX bank shares such as BEN need deposits and good profit margins to make their business profitable. Meaning, a bank gets money from term deposit holders and wholesale debt investors and lends that money to homeowners, businesses and investors. The difference between what a bank pays to savers and what it makes from mortgage holders (for example) is the net interest margin or NIM. Remember: when it comes to NIMs, the wider the margin the better.\n\nIf you are planning to estimate the profits of a bank like BEN or Bank of Queensland Limited (ASX: BOQ), knowing how much money the bank lends and what it makes per dollar lent to borrowers is important. That’s why the NIM is arguably the most important measure of BEN’s profitability. Across the ASX’s major bank shares, we calculated the average NIM to be 1.78% whereas Bendigo & Adelaide Bank Ltd’s lending margin was 1.9%, meaning the bank produced a better-than-average return from lending money to customers versus its peers.\n\nThe reason analysts study the NIM so closely is because Bendigo & Adelaide Bank Ltd earned 87% of its total income (akin to revenue) just from lending last year.\n\nROE: the measure of bank quality\n\nReturn on shareholder equity, also known as ‘ROE’, helps you compare the profit of a bank against its total shareholder equity, as shown on its balance sheet – the higher the ROE the better. Bendigo & Adelaide Bank Ltd’s ROE in the latest full year stood at 7.9%, meaning for every $100 of shareholder equity in the bank it produced $7.90 in yearly profit. This was below the sector average of 9.35%.\n\nBalance sheet protection\n\nFor Australia’s banks, the CET1 ratio (aka ‘common equity tier one’) is paramount. CET1 represents the bank’s capital buffer which can go towards protecting it against financial collapse – basically, it’s the proportion of total assets that are ‘liquid’ or readily available. According to our numbers, Bendigo & Adelaide Bank Ltd had a CET1 ratio of 11.3% last year. This was below the sector average.\n\nBEN share price valuation\n\nA dividend discount model or DDM is one of the most efficient ways to create a guesstimate of ASX bank shares. To do a DDM we have to take the bank’s last full year of dividends and then apply a risk rating. Last year the total dividend was $0.63. Let’s assume the BEN dividend payment expands at a consistent rate each year into the future, somewhere between 2% and 4%. We will use multiple risk rates (between 6% and 11%) and then average the valuations. The calculation we use is: Share price = full-year dividend / (risk rate – dividend growth rate).\n\nGrowth rate 2.00% 3.00% 4.00% Risk rate 6.00% $16.25 $21.67 $32.50 7.00% $13.00 $16.25 $21.67 8.00% $10.83 $13.00 $16.25 9.00% $9.29 $10.83 $13.00 10.00% $8.13 $9.29 $10.83 11.00% $7.22 $8.13 $9.29\n\nAccording to this quick and simple DDM model, an estimated average valuation of BEN shares is $13.32. However, using an ‘adjusted’ dividend payment (the expected future dividend) of $0.65 per share, which is the preferred measure because it uses forecast dividends, the valuation goes to $13.75. The valuation compares to BEN’s current share price of $10.24. Since the company’s dividends are fully franked, we can make a further adjustment and do a valuation based on a ‘gross’ dividend payment (this is the value of the dividend including the franking credit). Using gross dividend payments, the ‘fair value’ estimate becomes $19.64.\n\nWhat this means is that the BEN share price might seem expensive using a DDM model. It’s important to consider all of the risks and ideas we presented here, including the benefit of improving dividends and the compelling impact of franking credits.\n\nTo learn more about analysis and valuation, consider getting our free investment report emailed to you (keep reading). This should just be one of many steps when making an investment decision. Consider reading at least two or three years’ worth of Bendigo & Adelaide Bank Ltd annual reports and then seek out good investors and analysis that disagrees with your perspective – that’s a reliable way to figure out if you’re making a solid decision based on rigorous analysis and considering alternative opinions. Finally, before going any further with BEN or MQG shares, I suggest getting a copy of our free investment report."

         "The ASX: ANZ ) is currently trading around $35. Let’s run through two standard ANZ share price valuation tools an analyst might use to provide his or her share valuation on an ASX bank share like ANZ.\n\nAs you may know, this is the general version. Keep in mind, general doesn’t necessarily equal ‘good’. So, at the bottom of this article, we’ll provide some further resources to complement our potential indicative valuations. Basically, it goes without saying but these valuations are not guaranteed.\n\nBank shares like ANZ Banking Group, National Australia Bank Ltd (ASX: NAB) and Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA) are highly popular in Australia because of their reliable dividend history, and the added value of franking credits.\n\nIn this article, we’ll cover the basics of investing in ASX bank shares. If you’re interested to learn more about the value of dividend investing in Australia (including how franking credits work), you might like to check out our free online investing courses.\n\nFor access to our valuation models, videos and tutorials, consider subscribing to the Rask Australia YouTube channel.

Click here to subscribe.\n\n<span data-mce-type='bookmark' style='display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;' class='mce_SELRES_start'></span>\n\nA proper PE ratio for ANZ shares\n\nThe price-earnings ratio or ‘PER’ compares a company’s share price (P) to its most recent full-year earnings per share (E). Remember, ‘earnings’ is just another word for profit. Hence, the ‘P/E’ ratio is simply comparing share price to the most recent full-year profit of the company. Some experts will try to tell you that ‘the lower PE ratio is better’ because it means the share price is ‘low’ relative to the profits produced by the company. However, sometimes shares are cheap for a reason!\n\nSecondly, some extremely successful companies have gone for many years (a decade or more) and never reported an accounting profit — so the PE ratio can’t be used to value them.\n\nTherefore, we think it’s helpful to dig deeper than simply looking at the PE ratio and thinking to yourself ‘if it’s below 10x, I’ll buy it’.\n\nOne of the basic ratio models analysts use to value a bank share is to compare the PE ratio of the bank/share you’re looking at with its peer group or competitors and try to determine if the share price is excessive, or undervalued relative to the average. From there, and using the principle of mean reversion, we can multiply the profits/earnings per share by the sector average (E x sector PE) to reflect what an average company would be worth. It’s like saying, ‘if all of the other stocks are priced at ‘X’, this one should be too’.\n\nIf we take the ANZ share price today ($34.64), together with the earnings (aka profits) per share data from its FY24 financial year ($2.15), we can calculate the company’s PE ratio to be 16.1x. That compares to the banking sector average PE of 18x.\n\nNext, take the profits per share (EPS) ($2.15) and multiply it by the average PE ratio for ANZ’s sector (Banking). This results in a ‘sector-adjusted’ PE valuation of $38.70.\n\nANZ share price analysis\n\nThe dividend discount model or DDM is different from ratio valuation like PE because the model makes forecasts into the future, and uses dividends instead of profit. Because the banking sector has proven to be relatively stable with regards to share dividends, the DDM approach can be used. However, we would not use this model for, say, technology shares which are more growth focused.\n\nBasically, we need only one input into a DDM model: dividends per share. Then, we make some assumptions about the yearly increase of the dividend (e.g. 2%) and the risk level of the dividend payment (e.g. 7%). We’ve used the most recent full-year dividends (e.g. from last 12 months or LTM) then assumed the dividends remain consistent but grow slightly.\n\nTo do the valuation, use this formula: Share price = full-year dividend / (risk rate – dividend growth rate). It’s a good idea to do the calculation using a few different growth and risk assumptions, then take the average valuation. This helps to account for some of the uncertainty.\n\nTo simplify this DDM, we will assume last year’s dividend payment ($1.66) increases at a consistent rate each year.\n\nNext, we determine the ‘risk’ rate or expected return rate. This is the rate at which we discount the future dividend payments back to today’s dollars. A higher ‘risk’ rate results in a lower share price valuation.\n\nWe’ve used a blended rate for dividend growth and a risk rate between 6% and 11%, then averaged the results.\n\nThis approach yields a valuation of ANZ shares of $35.10. However, using an ‘adjusted’ dividend payment of $1.69 per share, the valuation goes to $35.74. The expected dividend valuation compares to ANZ Banking Group’s share price of $34.64.\n\nGrowth rate 2.00% 3.00% 4.00% Risk rate 6.00% $42.25 $56.33 $84.50 7.00% $33.80 $42.25 $56.33 8.00% $28.17 $33.80 $42.25 9.00% $24.14 $28.17 $33.80 10.00% $21.13 $24.14 $28.17 11.00% $18.78 $21.13 $24.14\n\nANZ share price: don’t stop with this\n\nSimple valuation models like these can be handy tools for analysing and valuing a bank share like ANZ Banking Group. These models can even make you feel warm and fuzzy inside because you have ‘put a value on it’.\n\nThat said, it’s far from a perfect valuation (as you can see). While no one can ever guarantee a return, there are things you can (and probably should) do to improve the valuation before you consider it as a worthwhile yardstick.\n\nFor instance, studying the growth or increase in total loans on the balance sheet is a very important thing to do: if they’re growing too fast it means the bank could be taking too much risk; too slow and the bank might be too conservative. Then, study the remainder of the financial statements for risks.\n\nAreas to focus on include the provisions for bad loans (income statement), their rules for assessing bad loans (accounting notes) and the sources of capital (wholesale debt markets or customer deposit). On the latter, take note of how much it costs the bank to get capital into its business to lend out to customers, keeping in mind that overseas debt markets are typically more risky than customer deposits due to exchange rates, regulation and the fickle nature of investment markets."

         "Key Takeaways\n\nU.S. online Black Friday sales hit a record $11.8 billion, a 9.1% increase year-over-year, significantly boosted by AI-powered shopping tools.\n\nEntry-level job postings have fallen 16% year-over-year, raising concerns for young workers as AI automation impacts the labor market, with youth unemployment reaching 10.5%.\n\nJapan is dedicating approximately $1.6 billion in an extra budget to bolster its AI and semiconductor industries, part of a long-term strategy to regain technological leadership.\n\nA Coinbase-funded Universal Basic Income experiment is distributing $12,000 in USDC cryptocurrency to 160 low-income New Yorkers, exploring digital assets for social aid.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent attributes a recovering bond market and restored White House strength to President Trump's economic policies, noting a 6% year-to-date return for the U.S. Treasury market.\n\nRecord Black Friday Sales Driven by AI as Consumer Spending Shifts Online\n\nAmerican shoppers demonstrated robust online spending on Black Friday, setting a new record of $11.8 billion, an impressive 9.1% increase from last year, according to Adobe Analytics. This surge was significantly influenced by AI-powered shopping tools, which saw an 805% increase in driven traffic to U.S. retail sites compared to the previous year. The widespread adoption of AI tools like Walmart's Sparky or Amazon's Rufus has enabled consumers to efficiently compare prices and secure discounts amidst persistent inflation and tighter budgets.\n\nMobile shopping played a crucial role, accounting for over half of all sales. Popular categories for Black Friday purchases included video game consoles, electronics, and home appliances. While online sales soared, in-store traffic remained subdued, reflecting a broader consumer shift towards digital platforms for holiday shopping. Looking ahead, Cyber Monday is projected to continue this trend, with an anticipated $14.2 billion in sales, marking it as the largest online shopping day of the year.\n\nLabor Market Concerns Rise as Entry-Level Job Postings Decline\n\nThe U.S. labor market is showing signs of strain for young workers, with entry-level job postings experiencing a 16% year-over-year decline. This trend is particularly worrying for recent graduates and those aged 16 to 24, whose unemployment rate climbed to 10.5% in August, the highest level since late 2016, excluding the pandemic period. Artificial intelligence-powered automation is identified as a key factor in this shift, as companies become more efficient and increasingly prioritize experienced professionals over entry-level hires.\n\nPlatforms like Handshake, a popular resource for entry-level job seekers, have reported a 15% reduction in listings compared to the last academic year, while the number of applications per job has risen by approximately 30%. This indicates a growing mismatch in the labor market, with fewer opportunities for those seeking to gain initial work experience. Experts suggest that while AI may create new jobs higher up the organizational chart, it is automating away many rote entry-level tasks, posing a significant challenge for the future workforce.\n\nJapan Boosts AI and Semiconductor Development with $1.6 Billion Investment\n\nJapan is making a significant move to strengthen its technological competitiveness, announcing an extra budget allocation of approximately ¥252.5 billion (US$1.6 billion) to advance its artificial intelligence (AI) and semiconductor industries. This investment is part of a larger strategic initiative that has seen Japan commit around ¥5.7 trillion (US$36.5 billion) since 2021 to revive its semiconductor sector and reduce reliance on foreign supply chains.\n\nThe funding will support key projects, including the domestic chip venture Rapidus, which aims to mass-produce cutting-edge 2-nanometer chips by 2027, as well as facilities by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) in Kumamoto and Micron Technology Inc.'s (MU) factory in Hiroshima. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) is also seeking funds to bolster Nippon Export and Investment Insurance and to secure national stockpiles of rare earths, crucial for high-tech manufacturing, further reducing dependence on China. This strategic shift towards more stable, long-term funding through regular budgets underscores Japan's commitment to becoming a global leader in these critical technologies.\n\nCoinbase-Funded Crypto UBI Experiment Launched in New York\n\nIn a novel initiative exploring the potential of digital assets for social welfare, a pilot Universal Basic Income (UBI) program funded by Coinbase (COIN) is distributing $12,000 in USDC stablecoin to 160 low-income residents in New York. The program, administered by the charity GiveDirectly, draws inspiration from traditional UBI experiments and aims to assess the effectiveness of cryptocurrency in providing unconditional financial support and improving financial stability for vulnerable populations.\n\nThe total funding for this project, approximately $2.6 million, originates from Coinbase's now-defunct GiveCrypto program. Participants will receive their payments in two stages: an initial lump sum of $8,000, followed by five monthly installments of $800. This experiment represents a significant step in bridging traditional social aid with blockchain technology, potentially paving the way for faster and more transparent payment methods in future social programs.\n\nBessent Touts Trump's Economic Leadership Amid Bond Market Recovery\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent has credited President Trump's economic policies for a recovering bond market and a restoration of White House strength. Speaking at the New York Fed's Treasury Market Conference, Bessent highlighted that the U.S. Treasury market has been the best-performing developed bond market this year, achieving 6% in total returns year-to-date, its strongest performance since 2020. He emphasized the critical role of Treasury yields in setting the global risk-free rate, which in turn influences a wide range of financial instruments, from bank loans to home mortgages.\n\nBessent also outlined the administration's plans for regulatory adjustments aimed at enhancing market liquidity, including a revamped Treasury buyback program. Furthermore, he projected a potential tenfold growth in the stablecoin market by the end of the decade, attributing this to the innovation fostered by the GENIUS Act. These statements underscore the administration's focus on maintaining a robust and liquid Treasury market as a cornerstone of economic affordability and stability.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

         "Mid-cap mutual funds are finding it increasingly hard to stay ahead. Fresh data shows that most active mid-cap fund managers are struggling to beat the very benchmark they’re supposed to outperform, intensifying the active vs passive investing debate in one of the market’s most dynamic segments.\n\nData collated by DSP Mutual Fund shows that, on average, just 34% of actively managed mid-cap funds have outperformed the benchmark index — Nifty Midcap 150 TRI (total return index) over the last six years.\n\nA five-year rolling return analysis (rolled daily from 1 April 2010 to 31 October 2025) reveals a clear trend: since 2018, both the magnitude of alpha and the proportion of outperformers have steadily declined.\n\nThis raises an important question: should investors now consider low-cost passive funds that simply track the index, or do actively managed funds still have a role in the mid-cap space?\n\nBut first, let's understand what’s driving this underperformance among mid-cap funds.\n\nAlso Read | How many mutual funds should you really own?\n\nWhy the struggle\n\nExperts say the underperformance isn’t driven by a single reason but a combination of factors.\n\n“Mid-cap funds have underperformed largely because active mid-cap managers are confined to the same universe of 150 mid-cap stocks, which is now widely tracked by both fund houses and analysts. To generate alpha, a manager must meaningfully deviate from the index and be right on those calls. That’s getting harder,\" pointed out Dhirendra Kumar, founder and chief executive officer of Value Research, an independent investment advisory firm.\n\nSebi’s 2017 re-categorisation rules tightened mid-cap fund portfolios by requiring at least 65% allocation to companies ranked 101–250 by market capitalization.\n\nThe above-mentioned analysis by DSP MF shows that the alpha (i.e. difference between returns generated by active mid-cap funds and Nifty Midcap 150 TRI) has been shrinking since 2018.\n\nThe TRI also accounts for dividend gains in the index returns. Similarly, the percentage of outperforming mid-cap funds has been ebbing. The study is based on five-year rolling returns (see graphic for details).\n\nMarkets have also become more efficient. The lower end of the mid-cap universe — the 250th stock — now has a market value of around ₹30,000 crore, almost double its December 2021 size.\n\n“Information asymmetry has reduced meaningfully, leaving fund managers with fewer opportunities the market hasn’t already priced in,\" says Siddharth Srivastava, head–ETF product & fund manager, Mirae Asset Investment Managers.\n\nAnalysts also point out that mid-cap funds might be struggling because there has been a broad-based earnings growth across different pockets of mid-caps in recent years.\n\n“The last five years have seen the mid-cap universe as a whole deliver high earnings growth. Going forward, if this earnings performance turns more selective, active funds would have a fighting chance,\" said Aarati Krishnan, head of advisory, Primeinvestor.in.\n\nWhile there has been a broad-based performance in mid-caps, mid-cap fund managers tend to take more active calls (i.e. deviating from index).\n\nMid-cap funds typically run a higher active share — about 60% versus large-cap funds’ 40%, pointed out Arun Kumar, author of The 80-20 Money Makeover and former head of research at FundsIndia.\n\nInvestment style is another reason. According to Anil Ghelani, head–passive investments and products, DSP Mutual Fund, quality as a factor has not done well in recent years, and mid-cap fund managers typically look for companies with high-quality fundamentals.\n\nMid-caps are inherently more volatile than large-caps. To manage downside risk, fund managers prefer companies with strong balance-sheets, predictable cash flows, good governance and steady earnings.\n\nDo actives still matter?\n\nOn the surface, the data favours passives. But experts caution against drawing large-cap-like conclusions too quickly.\n\n“All mid-caps can’t be painted in same brush. There are several industries and opportunities represented in the mid-cap space. So, it is still a bottom-up stock-picking play. Passive strategy is advisable in segments where information discovery has fully happened. For example, in the case of large-caps, where the company’s fundamentals and business model are already well-known and established,\" said Nirav Karkera, head of research at Fisdom, a wealth platform.\n\n\"Passive strategy works in large-cap space as institutional investors buy large-caps as a basket. For example, when foreign institutional investors are bullish on India, the allocation happens at Nifty 50-level. But mid-caps are more stock-specific. The underperformance of the mid-cap funds can be attributed to certain investment strategies not working out in recent years,\" said Karkera.\n\nRavi Kumar of Gaining Ground Investment Services warns that passive mid-cap indices force exposure to all constituents — even weaker names — and only exit laggards during periodic reshuffles. Active managers can respond sooner when fundamentals deteriorate.\n\n“Funds that have bet on banking, non-bank financial companies, power sector, etc. have delivered strong performance in recent years. If you are able to pick the right fund manager in the mid-cap space, you can still see significant outperformance,\" he added. In fact, mid-cap funds that beat the benchmark in 2024 outperformed by 3–38 percentage points.\n\nAlso Read | How you can get a digital loan against mutual funds\n\n\"In our experience, the proportion of funds outperforming the index in a category, does keep changing across time. Therefore we tend to switch between passive and active recommendations based on the data,\" Krishnan added. For example, about 69% of mid-cap funds outperformed benchmark index in 2024.\n\nValue Research’s Kumar added that when mid-cap funds outperform, they often do so by a wide margin. “Though identifying the eventual winners has become more challenging,\" he said.\n\nWhat should investors do?\n\nAdvisors suggest moderation instead of an abrupt switch.\n\n“With mid-caps currently overvalued, we are not allocating aggressively. Once valuations turn reasonable, we will use a combination of passive and active funds,\" says Vishal Dhawan, founder at Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors.\n\nHowever, mid-cap passive funds don’t have long track-record. The oldest mid-cap index fund was launched in 2019.\n\n“Hence, there is little real-market record of how these funds would perform in terms of controlling tracking error, especially during market stresses. As an alternate, funds tracking the Nifty Next 50 Index can be considered. It is not a true mid-cap index, but the risk-reward is similar to that of mid-caps, as it represents stocks beyond the widely-tracked Nifty 50 stocks,\" says Pattabiraman, founder of personal finance platform Freefincal.\n\nAlso Read | Decode your mutual fund using these 5 ratios\n\nIf you want pure mid-cap exposure through active management, focus on funds run by strong fund managers — but be prepared to track their performance against the benchmark closely. There are more diversified options such as flexicaps and multi-caps in the active space, where exposure is more spread out across market caps.\n\nOn the passive side, investors can still build pure mid-cap exposure, but it’s sensible to scale into these options gradually, as passive mid-cap funds are fairly new and need to demonstrate their ability to track the index efficiently."

         "In a village outside Botswana’s capital, Keorapetse Koko sat on an aging couch in her sparsely furnished home, stunned that a career — and an entire nation’s economy — built on diamonds had fallen so far, so fast.\n\nFor 17 years, she had earned a living cutting and polishing the gems that helped transform Botswana from one of the world’s poorest nations into one of Africa’s success stories. Diamonds were discovered in 1967, a year after independence, an abrupt change of fortune for the landlocked country.\n\nBotswana became the world’s top diamond producer by value, and second-largest by volume after Russia. Diamonds are woven into the national identity, with local Olympic champion runner Letsile Tebogo heading a De Beers campaign celebrating how the industry funds schools and stadiums.\n\nThe stones that Koko and thousands of others dug and polished over the decades have funded Botswana’s health, education, infrastructure and more. The country risked the “resource curse” of building its economy on a single natural asset — and unlike many African nations, it was a success.\n\nBut Koko lost her job a year ago, joining many others left adrift as Africa’s trade in natural diamonds buckles under growing pressure from cheaper lab-grown diamonds mass-produced mainly in China and India.\n\n“I have debts and I don’t know how I am going to pay them,” said the mother of two, who had survived on about $300 a month and relied on her employer for medical insurance. It had been a decent situation for a semi-skilled worker in a country where the average monthly salary is about $500. “Every month they call me asking for money. But where do I get it?”\n\n‘Diamonds built our country’\n\nBotswana, which has unearthed some of the world’s biggest stones, has prided itself on prudently managing its natural wealth, avoiding the corruption and fighting that have plagued many African peers. Its marketing message has been simple: Its stones are conflict-free and help fund development.\n\n“Diamonds built our country,” said Joseph Tsimako, president of the Botswana Mine Workers Union, which represents about 10,000 workers in the nation of 2.5 million people. “Now, as the world changes, we must find a way to make sure they don’t destroy the lives of the people who helped build it.”\n\nHe warned that new U.S. tariffs under the Trump administration could worsen Botswana’s downturn, triggering staffing freezes, unpaid leave and more layoffs. The U.S. has imposed a 15% tariff on diamonds that are mined, cut and polished there.\n\nDiamond exports, roughly 80% of Botswana’s foreign earnings and a third of government revenue, have tumbled.\n\nDebswana, the largest local diamond producer and a joint venture between the government and mining giant De Beers, saw revenues halve last year. It has paused operations at some mines as Botswana and Angola enter talks to take over controlling stakes in De Beers’ diamond mining unit.\n\nIn September, Botswana’s national statistics agency reported a 43% drop in diamond output in the second quarter, the steepest fall in the country’s modern mining history. The World Bank expects the economy to shrink 3% this year, the second consecutive contraction.\n\nThe rise of synthetic diamonds\n\nThe global rise of synthetic diamonds has been swift. They have “given stiff competition, especially in lower-quality stones,” said Siddarth Gothi, chairman of the Botswana Diamond Manufacturers Association.\n\nThe gems emerged in the 1950s for industrial use. By the 1970s they had reached jewelry quality. Lab-grown stones now sell for up to 80% less than natural diamonds. Once making up just 1% of global sales in 2015, they have surged to nearly 20%.\n\nGlitzy social media videos have fueled the appeal of synthetic gems made in weeks under intense heat and pressure and marketed as cheaper, conflict-free and eco-friendly alternatives to stones formed over billions of years.\n\nEnvironmental groups have said natural diamond mining can drive deforestation, destroy habitats, degrade the soil and pollute the water. But environmental claims about the synthetic gems also face scrutiny, with critics noting that production remains energy-intensive, often powered by fossil fuels.\n\nFrom “a marginal phenomenon,” an “unprecedented flood” of synthetics now threatens the natural diamond’s value and future, World Federation of Diamond Bourses president Yoram Dvash warned in July.\n\nLab-grown stones now account for most new U.S. engagement rings, he said. Natural diamond prices have fallen roughly 30% since 2022, leaving the industry at what Dvash called “a critical juncture.”\n\nHollywood stars, including Billie Eilish and Pamela Anderson, and Bollywood celebrities have boosted synthetic diamonds’ allure, along with Gen Z influencers.\n\n“The new generation of youngsters getting engaged, they’ve got far more important things to spend their money on than a diamond,” said Ian Furman, founder of Naturally Diamonds, which sells natural and synthetic diamonds in neighboring South Africa. “So, it’s become so attractive to them to buy lab diamonds.”\n\nFurman said that for every 100 diamonds his company sells, around 95 are synthetic when just five or six years ago it was overwhelmingly natural diamonds.\n\nAfrican producers feel the pain\n\nThe shift is felt beyond Botswana. Across southern Africa, falling production of natural diamonds and revenue have led to job cuts and financial strain.\n\nTo counter the trend, Botswana, Angola, Namibia, South Africa and Congo in June agreed to pool 1% of annual diamond revenues, translating into millions of dollars, into a global marketing push led by the Natural Diamond Council to promote natural stones. The nonprofit’s members include major mining companies such as De Beers Group and Rio Tinto, which have invested heavily in natural diamonds.\n\nLast year, the council launched a “Real. Rare. Responsible” campaign starring actor Lily James in a bid to recast natural diamonds as unique and ethically sourced.\n\nKristina Buckley Kayel, the council’s managing director for North America, said restoring natural diamonds’ “desirability” is essential to protect producer economies, particularly in southern Africa.\n\nWith its diamond income no longer assured, Botswana’s government in September created a sovereign wealth fund focused on investment and diversification beyond mining, although details about its value and investors sketchy. Suddenly, the country’s elephant-heavy tourism industry and other mining options, including gold, silver and uranium, are more important than ever.\n\nBut for Koko, the laid-off diamond worker, the policy shift may have come too late.\n\n“I was the breadwinner in a big family,” she said. “Now I don’t even know how to feed my own. Looking for another job is very difficult. The skills I learned are only relevant to the diamond industry.”\n\nShe never owned a diamond herself. Even the smallest would be a luxury beyond her means."

         "Key Points\n\nBuying a home is often the largest expenditure that a person will make in their lifetime.\n\nGiven the massive cost of a house, most people need to borrow money.\n\nTrump's idea of a 50-year mortgage will likely lower monthly loan payments by a little bit, but that's not the real story here.\n\n10 stocks we like better than AGNC Investment Corp. ›\n\nBuying a home is part of the American dream, but it is also one of the most expensive and challenging aspects of that dream. Making it possible for more people to buy homes is a frequent presidential goal, and Donald Trump is no exception in this regard.\n\nBut is the 50-year mortgage a good idea? It depends on whether you are the borrower or the lender. Here's what you need to know.\n\nIt usually comes down to a mortgage\n\nHouses are expensive, and most people need to borrow money to afford to buy a home. The loan that they typically use is called a mortgage. The key feature of a mortgage is that it is a self-amortizing loan. That sounds fancy, but it just means that each monthly payment includes an interest payment and a payment toward the principal of the loan.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nEssentially, you are paying down the loan as you go along so that, when the mortgage is paid off at the end of the loan period, there is nothing left to pay. Some investors view this as a form of forced savings, as each mortgage payment helps build equity in your home.\n\nThat said, there's an interesting twist here. Early in the loan, when the principal is largest, the vast majority of the monthly payment goes toward interest. Over time, as the principal is slowly paid down, interest expenses make up an increasingly smaller portion of the monthly payment. This is vital to understand when examining the benefits of taking out a typical 30-year mortgage versus the proposed 50-year mortgage.\n\nIf you bought a $450,000 home with a 30-year mortgage and a 6.25% interest rate, your monthly payment would be $2,771. A 50-year mortgage at the same rate would lower the monthly payment to $2,452, according to a CNN analysis.\n\nThat's a notable drop, but there's a hidden cost to those savings. Because of the self-amortizing nature of mortgage loans, you are paying more in interest over the life of the loan when you extend the maturity by 20 years. The total amount you'd pay your mortgage lender in interest would be roughly $547,000 with the 30-year loan and a huge $1.02 million with a 50-year loan. So the 50-year loan would cost the homebuyer nearly twice as much in interest.\n\nMortgage lenders would be the big winners\n\nPretty clearly, the real winner here is the mortgage lender. To be fair, there is more risk in providing a 50-year loan, as there's more time for unfavorable events to occur. However, given the financial benefits, even the largest banks would likely jump at the chance to offer customers 50-year mortgage loans."

         "Key Points\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF is well diversified and can be purchased through many brokerages for $100 or less.\n\nTechnology is driving the growth of the stock market and is likely to benefit as artificial intelligence continues to evolve.\n\nThe ETF charges a very low expense ratio, allowing you to keep more of your returns.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Vanguard Information Technology ETF ›\n\nThe technology sector is booming right now, largely due to the monumental growth of artificial intelligence (AI). But picking long-term tech winners is notoriously difficult, and it can be safer to spread your money out among many companies.\n\nThat's what makes buying a technology exchange-traded fund (ETF) a good idea. You'll be invested in a variety of leading tech players and benefit regardless of who dominates. You can also invest just $100, or even less, depending on which brokerage you use.\n\nIf this sounds appealing to you, here's why buying the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: VGT) is a great place to put your money right now.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nTech will likely dominate the market's returns for years to come\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology fund spreads its investment across 300 small- and large-cap technology companies, tracking the MSCI US Investable Market Information Technology 25/50 Index. This provides investors with exposure to a range of top semiconductor and software companies, including Nvidia and Microsoft.\n\nThe fund currently has more than 51% of its holdings in semiconductor and software companies, with the remainder comprising tech hardware, application software, communications equipment, and other related industries. Not only is this significant diversification, but because the fund is invested in both large and small-cap companies, you won't miss out on owning rising disruptors in the industry.\n\nIt is also important to note that technology stocks have been a dominant force in the stock market's rise, essentially since the 1990s. The AI boom is the latest iteration of technology's influence on the market, and there's no end in sight for the influence of technology stocks.\n\nThe result has been very positive for investors who own the Vanguard Information Technology ETF. The fund has had an average annual return of 14.4% since its inception in 2004.\n\nOf course, there's no guarantee it will continue at that pace. Still, it's an indicator of how well the fund can perform when technology companies are benefiting from long-term opportunities, such as the early days of the internet, mobile devices, and now AI."

         "The company generates revenue primarily through service fees charged to clients and freelancers for facilitating talent sourcing, contracting, collaboration, and payment processing on its platform.\n\nUpwork provides an online work marketplace connecting businesses with independent professionals and agencies across a wide range of categories, including sales, marketing, IT, and creative services.\n\nWas there any notable movement in Upwork's stock price around the transaction dates? Upwork shares closed at $19.58 on November 26, 2025, with the weighted average sale price at $19.51 per share; the stock posted a one-year total return of 16.3% as of the transaction date.\n\nHow does the transaction compare to Ms. Brown's historical selling patterns? Over the past year, Ms. Brown made 15 sell trades with a median size of 40,000 shares for sell-only events and 28,741 shares across all trade events, making this 350,000-share sale the largest single disposition in the observed period and well above both medians.\n\nDid the transaction exhaust Ms. Brown's available direct ownership or leave a meaningful residual stake? After the transaction, Ms. Brown retained 697,894 shares directly, valued at approximately $13.7 million as of November 26, 2025, which accounts for 0.53% of Upwork's outstanding shares based on the latest reported figures.\n\nHow significant was the transaction relative to Hayden Brown's direct holdings? The 350,000 shares sold represented 33.4% of Ms. Brown's direct holdings immediately prior to the transaction, a substantial reduction compared to the historical median sell trade of 30,672 shares (2.19% of holdings per trade in the past year).\n\nHayden Brown, President & CEO of Upwork (NASDAQ:UPWK), disclosed the sale of 350,000 shares in multiple open-market transactions on November 25, 2025 and November 26, 2025; see the SEC Form 4 filing for details.\n\nCEO Hayden Brown sold about a third of her holdings in Upwork stock.\n\nStory Continues\n\nUpwork, Inc. operates at scale as a leading online staffing and employment services platform, leveraging technology to streamline remote talent engagement for businesses worldwide. The company’s strategic focus on digital marketplace efficiency and secure payment solutions positions it as a key enabler in the evolving flexible workforce landscape.\n\nUpwork's broad talent pool and comprehensive platform functionalities offer a competitive edge in serving diverse client needs across industries.\n\nFoolish take\n\nCEO Hayden Brown's sale of 350,000 shares in Upwork is noteworthy because it's a significant portion of her holdings. The company's stock hit a 52-week high of $20.54 in September, and remained elevated at the time of her sale. This suggests Ms. Brown was taking advantage of this to capture some gains.\n\nHayden Brown continues to own nearly 700,000 Upwork shares, so her November disposition isn't necessarily a red flag for shareholders to sell. That said, the substantial size of her sale understandably raises concerns.\n\nSo far, Upwork is experiencing respectable performance in 2025. It reached record quarterly revenue of $201.7 million in the third quarter, representing a 4% year-over-year increase. Its Q3 net income rose 6% year over year to $29.3 million.\n\nThe company expects full-year 2025 revenue to range between $782 million and $787 million, which is an increase over 2024's $769.3 million. This is a positive sign, although not spectacular sales growth.\n\nUpwork stock's price-to-earnings ratio of about 11 hovers near a high point for 2025, signifying shares are on the pricey side. This indicates now is a good time to sell, which may have contributed to Hayden Brown's large disposition. However, in terms of whether to buy, the earnings multiple signals now is not a good time to pick up shares.\n\nGlossary\n\nOpen-market transaction: The buying or selling of securities on a public exchange, not through private agreements.\n\nSEC Form 4: A required filing disclosing insider trades by company officers, directors, or significant shareholders.\n\nWeighted average purchase price: The average price paid per share, weighted by the number of shares in each transaction.\n\nDirect ownership: Shares held personally and directly by an individual, not through trusts or indirect means.\n\nOutstanding shares: The total number of a company's shares currently held by all shareholders.\n\nDisposition: The act of selling or otherwise transferring ownership of an asset or security.\n\nTotal return: The investment's price change plus all dividends and distributions, assuming those payouts are reinvested.\n\nService fees: Charges collected by a platform for facilitating transactions or providing services to users.\n\nTalent sourcing: The process of finding and recruiting skilled professionals for specific roles or projects.\n\nPayment processing: Handling and transferring payments between parties, often through a secure online system.\n\nTTM: The 12-month period ending with the most recent quarterly report.\n\n\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

         "Key Points\n\nCameco has seen significant stock gains as interest in nuclear energy grows.\n\nEnergy needs are growing, largely driven by the increasing number of data centers.\n\nCameco and others have joined with the U.S. government to build new reactors.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Cameco ›\n\nIt's been quite an exciting ride for investors in Cameco (NYSE: CCJ), who have seen the stock rise 63% this year and more than 251% over the past three years. As the world once again embraces nuclear energy, Cameco is one uranium company that stands to benefit.\n\nThe U.S. government is making an effort to \"unleash American energy.\" It's investing heavily in nuclear infrastructure and streamlining the approval process to meet the country's soaring energy demands.\n\nCameco's stock has recently pulled back from its 52-week high and is now 24% below that level, trading under $90. With nuclear energy having a revival, is the stock a smart buy at this price? Let's examine the company and its long-term opportunities to find out.\n\nSoaring demand creates a need for more energy\n\nEnergy demand is soaring, driven by the explosion of power-hungry data centers running artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. According to a Goldman Sachs report, data center power demand is expected to account for 8% of total U.S. demand by 2030, up from 3% just two years ago.\n\nNot only will data centers drive energy growth, but demand across the board is expected to increase. Research from the Bank of America Institute projects that U.S. electricity demand will grow 2.5% annually, a rate five times faster than the previous decade, when demand grew 0.5% per year.\n\nThis surge in energy demand illustrates why the U.S. needs more infrastructure and why companies like Cameco stand to benefit.\n\nThe miner is well-positioned with its uranium assets\n\nCameco is one of the world's largest uranium producers, with assets in key uranium-producing regions in Canada and Kazakhstan. The company holds stakes in McArthur River (70% ownership) and Cigar Lake (55%), both of which are high-grade uranium mines in northern Canada. In the same area, it also owns an 83% stake in the Key Lake uranium mill, which processes ore to extract and concentrate uranium. In addition, it has a 40% interest in Joint Venture Inkai in Kazakhstan.\n\nBesides mines, Cameco holds a 49% stake in Westinghouse through a strategic partnership with Brookfield Renewable Partners. Westinghouse is an original equipment manufacturer of nuclear reactor technology and a global provider of products and services to commercial utilities and government agencies."

         "Key Points\n\nBitcoin remains the best cryptocurrency for long-term investors.\n\nIts status as \"digital gold\" may never change.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Bitcoin ›\n\nIn my view, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) remains the best cryptocurrency to own over the next 100 years. While other investors get involved in other cryptocurrencies, including altcoins and meme coins, there's one reason you should never give up on Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin will forever be digital gold\n\nIt is very rare for an asset to be considered a global store of value. A store-of-value asset is exactly what it sounds like -- investors can reasonably expect it to maintain its value in a variety of conditions. From war and famine to years of plenty, these assets have continually shown that they can outlast temporary volatility.\n\nWhat are some examples? The most popular are land, collectibles, gold, and other precious metals. Notice something similar about these assets? While more land may be developed, more collectibles identified, and more gold mined, the total quantity of each can never increase.\n\nThe amount of available land will be the same 100 years from now. And while collectibles are still being created, they aren't making any more wine bottled in the 1700s, nor are they producing more 1960s classic cars. Whatever there is today is all there ever will be. The same is true for gold and other precious metals. More may be mined, but more can't be created.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWith stock markets trading at very high valuations, investors are wise to seek out alternative assets, such as land, collectibles, and precious metals like gold. Bitcoin should be near the top of that list. Yes, more Bitcoin is mined every day. But there's a limit to how many coins can exist. The maximum long-term supply is 21 million, and 19 million have already been mined. This makes Bitcoin a scarce asset, similar to other store-of-value assets.\n\nGold has been valued by humans for thousands of years. Land, of course, has been valued by humans since the dawn of time. Very rarely do new assets appear that have global recognition of value simply by existing.\n\nBitcoin is one of those assets. And while its history is relatively short, Bitcoin's total market cap reflects this reality. The total value of land globally is at least several hundred trillion dollars. Gold, meanwhile, has a market cap of around $24 trillion. Bitcoin, however, has a total market cap of under $2 trillion.\n\nThere's a lot of room for Bitcoin to run compared to gold's long history. And while there may be a lot of volatility along the way, Bitcoin's total supply cap continues to make it a multidecade holding."

         "Key Points\n\nWaning consumption of alcohol is taking a toll on this company’s top and bottom lines.\n\nInvestors may be too focused on the past and present when they should be looking to the future.\n\nShares of a reinvented Constellation pose minimal risk here, and bring plenty of potential upside.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Constellation Brands ›\n\nIt's been a tough past couple of years for Constellation Brands (NYSE: STZ) shareholders. The stock's down more than 50% from its early 2024 peak, and seemingly still moving lower. The end of the COVID-19 pandemic's worst and the beginning of an inflation-riddled period is taking a double-barreled toll on alcohol consumption. Not only are people drinking less of it for health-minded reasons, but for cost-related reasons as well.\n\nThe sellers, however, have arguably overshot their target, ignoring how the company's foreseeable future looks much better than its recent past. This budding turnaround makes the pullback an attractive entry opportunity for patient investors.\n\nConstellation Brands is on the defensive\n\nYou may know the company better than you think. Constellation is parent to popular beer brands Modelo and Corona, which account for the bulk of its revenue. It also owns a handful of smaller wine brands, like Kim Crawford and Ruffino, as well as spirits like High West whiskey and Mi Campo tequila.\n\nThe $23 billion company did $10.2 billion worth of business last fiscal year, up slightly from the previous year's top line.\n\nThat would be the end of a respectable growth streak, though. Sales are down 10% through the six-month stretch ending in August. Gross profits and operating profits are similarly lower, mostly thanks to \"a difficult socioeconomic environment that dampened consumer demand across the industry.\"\n\nThat's not an inaccurate explanation. The Beer Institute reports that through September, shipment volume is down 5%, jibing with data from the Brewers Association. Separately but simultaneously, a recent survey from Gallup confirms the business' worst fears -- a record-low 54% of American adults are now regular drinkers, with a majority of this crowd citing health concerns as their top reason for cutting back.\n\nTo this end, Constellation Brands' guidance for the full year ending in February suggests a 4% to 6% top-line dip, leading to a slightly bigger decline in operating income.\n\nThe bullish case\n\nBut things are about to change in a way the market isn't pricing in -- or even seeing -- yet. In simplest terms, think of 2025 as a reconfiguration year for Constellation Brands. It's rebuilding a better business for what should (hopefully) be a better business environment."

         "(Bloomberg) -- Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA Chief Executive Officer Luigi Lovaglio and two prominent Italian investors allegedly coordinated actions to seize control of Mediobanca SpA and tighten their grip on Assicurazioni Generali SpA, according to documents compiled in a probe by Milan prosecutors.\n\nProsecutors describe an alleged multiyear strategy by billionaire Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone and Chairman Francesco Milleri of Delfin Sarl, two of the largest investors in Mediobanca and Generali, to take control of the Milan-based investment bank — with the ultimate goal of controlling Generali, Italy’s biggest insurer.\n\nA key step in the plan was last year’s purchase of a Monte Paschi stake by Italy’s government, part of a process prosecutors described as orchestrated and lacking transparency.\n\nAfter the purchase, Caltagirone and Milleri built up a deal in coordination with Lovaglio that allowed Monte Paschi to take over Mediobanca, without properly disclosing their alignment to the market to the potential detriment of other investors, according to the 35-page document seen by Bloomberg.\n\nProsecutors allege the project was executed in breach of Italian market rules and through coordinated behavior that was capable of influencing Mediobanca’s share price.\n\nMonte Paschi completed the €17 billion ($19.7 billion) acquisition of Mediobanca in September, creating Italy’s third-largest lender by assets in a government-backed deal.\n\nMilan prosecutors are investigating alleged market manipulation by Lovaglio, Milleri and Caltagirone and obstruction of regulators tied to Monte Paschi’s takeover of its smaller rival. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s government and the Finance Ministry in Rome aren’t under investigation and none of the individuals or companies have been charged with wrongdoing.\n\nProsecutors allege that concealed coordination meant the participants didn’t have to pool their stakes and allowed them to avoid the obligation to launch a costly mandatory cash takeover bid once their combined stake surpassed the 25% threshold in Mediobanca.\n\nMonte Paschi said Thursday the bank “is confident it can provide all the necessary information to clarify the correctness of its actions.” Delfin said its board “always acted in full compliance with market rules and laws.” Caltagirone Group said its representatives “consistently acted in accordance with the rules governing the market.”\n\nAll declined to comment further when reached by Bloomberg outside business hours on Saturday.\n\nThe documents trace the origins of the project back almost a decade.\n\nDelfin and the Caltagirone group have been significant shareholders since at least 2016. Starting in 2019, they allegedly pursued control through parallel and coordinated investments in both Generali and its main shareholder, Mediobanca.\n\nMediobanca is the largest shareholder in Generali with a 13.2% stake. Delfin — the Del Vecchio family’s holding company — owns 10.1% of the insurer and Caltagirone controls 6.3%, according to Generali’s website.\n\nDelfin also holds 17.5% in Monte Paschi and Caltagirone has a 10.3% stake, making them among that bank’s largest shareholders — and both built sizeable positions in Mediobanca before committing their shares to the offer.\n\nThe overlapping stakes created a dense web of influence linking Italy’s largest insurer, its main shareholder Mediobanca and Monte Paschi — the vehicle used in the takeover.\n\nInvestigators allege the two camps gradually converged, with stakes in Generali and Mediobanca rising in lockstep and their voting behavior becoming increasingly aligned.\n\nTreasury Role\n\nThe strategy entered its final phase in November 2024, when Italy’s Treasury sold a 15% stake in Monte Paschi through an accelerated bookbuilding, according to the documents, elements of which were reported earlier by Corriere della Sera.\n\nProsecutors say the sale was structured in a way that favored buyers aligned with the Mediobanca takeover plan — namely Caltagirone and Delfin, which offered the same price for the same number of shares within minutes of each other.\n\nA rapid closing of the order book shut out other interested investors such as UniCredit SpA and BlackRock Inc.\n\nWhile the Finance Ministry and its representatives aren’t under investigation, the document cites the government’s role, arguing the sale was characterized by “opacity and anomalies.”\n\nThe sale appeared steered toward predetermined buyers, raising questions over potential conflicts of interest given the Treasury’s dual role as both seller of the stake and late backer of Monte Paschi’s offer, according to the court documents.\n\nItaly’s Finance Ministry acted in compliance with rules and procedures, an official told Bloomberg on Saturday when asked to comment on the investigation.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com"

         "Key Points\n\nPool Corporation's shares have lost about one-third of their value over the past year.\n\nThe stock's performance is even worse when measured against the S&P 500.\n\nOver three and five years, the stock's performance is better, but the performance against the market is worse.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Pool ›\n\nLegendary investor Warren Buffett has gotten plenty of criticism over the years. Much of it has stemmed from his decisions to hold on to slumping stocks in his Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio if he believes in the long-term potential of their underlying businesses. This long-term buy-and-hold strategy has made him a multibillionaire and silenced most of his critics.\n\nHowever, even Buffett admits that he's made some mistakes over the years. Could Berkshire's recent buy of pool equipment wholesaler Pool Corp. (NASDAQ: POOL) be a mistake? Here's how the stock has treated its investors who bought in before Buffett, and how it might treat investors today.\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1 year: How Pool stock has done for Buffett\n\nBerkshire Hathaway first announced that it had bought shares of Pool about a year ago. Over the past year, though, the stock has been a big underperformer, with shares sliding from about $400 per share a year ago to the $300 per share range by April 2025, and to only about $245 a share today. That's a drop of about 33%, meaning that investors who bought in around the same time as Berkshire have lost roughly one-third of their investment.\n\nThat's bad, but things look even worse when you factor in that the S&P 500 has actually risen by about 14% over that time. This means that investing in Pool has underperformed the broader market by about 47 percentage points. Most analysts think the slumping housing market is to blame, as new pool installations occur when a house is built, and major repairs and renovations are likely to happen when a house is being prepared for sale.\n\nBut that's just the past year. How has Pool stock done over the longer term?\n\n3 years and 5 years: Medium-term performance\n\nPool has actually done even worse over the medium term. Its three- and five-year performances are slightly better on an absolute basis, with shares of the stock only down about 26% since November 2022 and 25% since November 2020. But when we factor in the opportunity costs, the results look really bad.\n\nBecause the S&P 500 has grown by nearly 75% over the last three years and nearly 100% over the last five years, the opportunity cost of taking a stake in Pool has been massive -- about 100 percentage points over three years and 125 percentage points over five. For investors who bought during the company's peak in late 2021, as lockdown-era pool installations skyrocketed during the pandemic's height, the performance is even worse."

Digital asset market adoption continues and customers require modular custody solutions.\n\nThis acquisition combines Paxos’ expertise in infrastructure and qualified custody “with Fordefi’s multi-party computation (MPC) wallet architecture, policy engine and deep decentralized finance integrations.”\n\nClients will be able to build upon a platform to issue stablecoins, tokenize assets and build complex payment flows “while maintaining the highest standards for security and compliance.”\n\nCharles Cascarilla, CEO and co-Founder of Paxos, commented that they have built Paxos as a neutral, enterprise-grade platform “that ushers the world’s enterprises into the digital asset economy.”\n\nThey added that Fordefi has built a stack and customer base founded “on easy-to-use APIs and seamless web3 connectivity.”\n\nMarket participants require a regulated platform partner “that meets their range of complex custody needs.”\n\nTogether, Paxos and Fordefi provide customers “with a custody solution built upon advanced wallet technology and regulated, qualified custody.”\n\nThey’re eager to “welcome Fordefi to their team as we enter this new phase of growth.”\n\nFounded in 2021 with offices in New York and Tel Aviv, Fordefi is described as the institutional-grade “multi-party computation (MPC) wallet platform built to solve the security, connectivity and policy challenges of decentralized finance.”\n\nFordefi will continue operating its “product independently and customers can continue using the product as usual.”\n\nOver time, Paxos will integrate Fordefi’s technology and “operations into its infrastructure. The terms of the transaction were not disclosed.”\n\n“Fordefi has built a wallet platform trusted by “nearly 300 institutions.”\n\nJosh Schwartz, CEO of Fordefi said that joining Paxos allows them to bring their technology to an even broader audience “while maintaining our focus on security, usability and innovation.”\n\nTogether, they will offer enterprises the “unified custody and stablecoin infrastructure they need to deploy real-world digital asset use cases at scale.”\n\nAs noted in the update, Paxos is the regulated blockchain infrastructure and tokenization platform.\n\nIts products are the foundation for a “new, open financial system that can operate faster and more efficiently.”\n\nCurrently, trillions of dollars are locked in “inefficient, outdated financial plumbing that is inaccessible to millions of people.”\n\nPaxos is replatforming the financial system to enable assets “to instantaneously move anywhere in the world, at any time, in a trustworthy way.”\n\nPaxos partners with global enterprises “to tokenize, custody and trade assets.”\n\nIts blockchain solutions are used by PayPal, Interactive Brokers, Mastercard, Mercado Libre and Nubank.\n\nPaxos is licensed to engage in virtual currency business activity “by the NYDFS and is the issuer of numerous regulated digital assets including PayPal USD (PYUSD), Pax Dollar (USDP) and Pax Gold (PAXG).”\n\nGlobal Dollar (USDG) is issued by Paxos Digital Singapore, which is “a Major Payments Institution supervised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.”\n\nUSDG is also issued by Paxos Issuance Europe under the supervision “of FIN FSA and in compliance with MiCA.”\n\nUSDG is available on Solana.\n\nPrudentially regulated by FIN-FSA in Europe, the NYDFS in the US, the MAS in Singapore and FSRA in Abu Dhabi Global Market, Paxos is a fintech with $500 million+ reportedly raised from investors including “Oak HC/FT, Declaration Partners, Founders Fund and PayPal Ventures.”"

         "S&P Global may have somewhat surprised the stablecoin sector this past week after cutting Tether’s rating to “weak,” citing persistent disclosure gaps and structural opacity across its reserves. The downgrade appears have put fresh scrutiny on the world’s largest stablecoin, Tether (USDT), and analysts at several digital-asset research desks are looking into the underlying factors driving the move.\n\nTheir early read indicates a mix of regulatory pressure, liquidity concerns, and seemingly long-standing transparency issues, and they are outlining what this shift could potentially mean for market stability in the weeks ahead.\n\nJake Kennis, research analyst at Nansen said:\n\n“Despite the downgrade, USDT remains fully collateralized with redemptions, its peg mechanism, and it’s liquidity profile functioning normally. The assessment cites Tether’s increased allocation to BTC and gold as “higher-risk” assets, along with limited visibility into the credit quality of certain counterparties. We’re not taking a view on those specific claims, but strictly from an onchain perspective, USDT continues to behave like the most liquid stablecoin.”\n\nOnchain data shows the peg holding quite firmly, “24h volumes above $85B, and no meaningful outflows from exchanges or indications of heavy redemption pressure.”\n\nIn short, market behavior suggests “participants are largely dismissing the downgrade and continue to treat USDT as reliably redeemable at 1:1 which is consistent with its historical performance through past periods of stress.”\n\nSharing perspectives from two of the most active operators in the stablecoin economy (Eco and Fireblocks) on S&P’s new assessment of USDT. Both note that the downgrade leans heavily on hypothetical modeling that doesn’t align with how USDT actually behaves under stress or how institutions use it today.\n\nRyne Saxe, CEO of Eco said:\n\n“S&P assigns outsized weight to the presence of Bitcoin and other non-USD assets, yet the actual market behavior of USDT doesn’t necessarily support that level of modeled risk. The token has held redemptions and stability through far more severe Bitcoin drawdowns than anything reflected in the report, which makes the downgrade feel more theoretical than empirical.”\n\nRan Goldi, SVP of Payments and Network at Fireblocks shared:\n\n“Stablecoins now underpin payments and treasury flows for institutions, corporates, fintechs, and even governments. The S&P downgrade reflects a model of reserve and disclosure risk, not a change in USDT’s ability to settle or redeem 1:1. It evaluates hypothetical volatility in a small part of the reserves, not the redemption mechanics these organizations rely on for cross-border settlement, payouts, and on-chain treasury. For them, it’s business as usual.”\n\nIt’s worthwhile to note that the latest assessment from S&P Global may not necessarily be valid or even reliable in pure statistical methodology terms. The ratings may largely be based on traditional financial system models and cannot accurately capture the more dynamic and evolving nature of the crypto and web3 space.\n\nIn the past, especially during its early years, Tether’s USDT stablecoin was heavily scrutinized because the stablecoin issuer’s reserves were not being held in the most transparent manner. Since that time, Tether‘s business model has improved and the company even ranks among the world’s leaders in terms of recent gold purchases. In fact, Tether may have bought more gold during these past few months than the central banks of many nations.\n\nTether is also not operating in a vacuum. Clearly, its USDT stablecoin and various other products are now part of a very active crypto trading, staking, and investing ecosystem. It is quite possible that the ratings assigned by S&P Global may change over time and after Tether becomes even more firmly entrenched in fast-maturing crypto space, it may potentially receive improved ratings / assessments.\n\nDespite the downgrade, the stablecoin seemingly remains unaffected and continues to maintain its 1 to 1 peg with the US dollar. Other stablecoins like Circle’s USDC has also become a trusted way to transact in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. And even though S&P Global issued its downgraded rating, it is still interesting how these digital assets have become significant enough in a short period of time to gain the attention of mainstream financial services providers."

Let’s take a look at why investors might be interested in WES shares.\n\nWesfarmers is a diversified Australian conglomerate headquartered in Perth. It’s essentially a listed investment company with outright ownership or significant stakes in companies across retail, chemical, fertiliser, industrial and safety brands and products.\n\nWesfarmers has a long history of buying businesses, re-investing in them to grow cash flow and assets, then selling them off for a higher price. A good example of this is Coles Group, which it bought in 2007 and spun out in 2018. However, most of the company’s operating profit (over 50%) comes from Bunnings Warehouse, the #1 hardware and home improvement business in Australia (and the country’s most trusted brand in 2023 & 2024). Wesfarmers originally bought into Bunnings in 1987, buying the final 52% in 1994 for $594 million.\n\nOther household names owned by Wesfarmers include Blackwoods, Kmart, Target, Officeworks, and Priceline Pharmacy. Wesfarmers has been a leading blue chip stock on the ASX for decades and is known for paying a consistent dividend.\n\nThe appeal of ASX Consumer Discretionary shares\n\nThe S&P/ASX200 Consumer Discretionary Index (ASX: XDJ) has returned 6.89% per year over the last 5 years compared to 5.51% per year from the broader ASX 200. The consumer discretionary sector covers a broad range of goods and services, so it can be hard to compare companies in this group. However, here are a few things you might want to consider when investing in a consumer discretionary company like WES.\n\nTiming\n\nConsumer discretionary companies usually have their best performance when interest rates are low. Just think about it – when rates are low, you’re more likely to go out and buy those ‘toys’ or things that you may not really need, but you certainly want. That could be new tech, travel, or your new power tools – it all comes under this category.\n\nDespite the current high interest rate environment, WES has still managed to grow revenue by 9.2% per year over the last three years.\n\nDividends\n\nThe dividends you’ll receive can vary with the current economic environment, but historically many of the big ASX consumer discretionary shares have been reliable dividend payers.\n\nWES offers a current dividend yield of 2.4% and over the last 5 years has averaged 3.4%.\n\nFamiliarity\n\nWe’re often advised to invest in what we know. Consumer discretionary shares may be a good fit then, as these tend to be companies that we see on a daily basis and their business model is easy to understand. You probably have a better idea how Wesfarmers Ltd make their money than some niche tech company or a B2B industrials company.\n\nThis doesn’t necessarily mean performance will be any good, but they’re definitely easier to get your head around when you’re starting out investing.\n\nWES share price valuation\n\nOne way to have a ‘fast read’ of where the WES share price is would be to study something like dividend yield through time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the ‘cash flow’ to a shareholder, but it can fluctuate year-to-year or between payments. Currently, Wesfarmers Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 2.42%, compared to its 5-year average of 3.36%. Put simply, WES shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield.\n\nBe careful how you interpret this information though – it could mean that dividends have fallen, or that the share price is increasing. In the case of WES, last year’s dividend was greater than the 3-year average, so the dividend has been growing.\n\nThe Rask websites offer free online investing courses, created by analysts explaining things like Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Dividend Discount Models (DDM). They even include free valuation spreadsheets! Both of these models would be a better way to value the WES share price."

         "Importantly, CoreWeave's long-term growth story remains intact. That's evident from the company's massive revenue backlog of just under $56 billion at the end of the previous quarter. CoreWeave was sitting on a backlog of $15 billion a year ago, so this metric almost quadrupled. The massive leap in CoreWeave's backlog can be attributed to the ever-growing demand for AI compute capacity.\n\nThe company had to trim its guidance because of a delay in the delivery of data center capacity by a third-party developer. CoreWeave said that this delay is temporary, and the impacted customer has agreed to maintain the total contract value and has adjusted the delivery schedule. So, this is a short-term impact that CoreWeave should be able to overcome.\n\nCoreWeave investors got another shock recently after the company released its third-quarter results. Though it reported massive year-over-year growth of 134% in its revenue to $1.36 billion, CoreWeave had to slightly reduce its full-year guidance. It now expects full-year revenue to land at $5.1 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range, down from the earlier estimate of $5.25 billion.\n\nCoreWeave went public toward the end of March, and it was the biggest tech IPO in the U.S. since 2021. Shares of the company rose impressively over the next few months and hit a high on June 20. However, it has been all downhill for CoreWeave since then, with the stock losing over 60% of its value.\n\nFormally known as neocloud companies, both CoreWeave and Nebius have seen incredible jumps in their stock prices this year. While CoreWeave is up 84% since its initial public offering (IPO) in late March this year, Nebius stock has shot up a stunning 231% this year. But if you had to choose from one of these two neocloud stocks for your portfolio right now, which one should it be?\n\nCoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) and Nebius Group (NASDAQ: NBIS) are two companies that have been growing at an incredible pace owing to their business model. These companies are in the business of building data centers capable of running artificial intelligence (AI) workloads and renting them out to hyperscalers, AI companies, or anyone looking to buy dedicated AI data center capacity.\n\nHowever, one of these names is trading at a much cheaper valuation than the other one.\n\nBoth companies seem set to deliver outstanding growth in the long run thanks to their huge backlogs.\n\nCoreWeave and Nebius are growing at incredible rates thanks to the booming demand for data center compute.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company has received massive contracts from Meta Platforms, OpenAI, and other hyperscalers who are looking to purchase AI compute capacity. As a result, CoreWeave is bringing new capacity online at an aggressive pace. It increased its contracted data center power capacity by 600 megawatts (MW) to 2.9 gigawatts in Q3.\n\nAdditionally, it brought online 120 MW of new capacity in Q3. CoreWeave had a total active data center capacity of 590 MW at the end of the previous quarter. The contracted capacity makes it clear that CoreWeave is on track to bring online more capacity, and that should allow it to convert its sizable backlog into revenue.\n\nAnother thing worth noting here is that CoreWeave has built a diversified customer base. It now has 10 large customers, thereby reducing its reliance on one or two names, and almost all of them have signed multiple contracts with CoreWeave. So, this AI stock seems primed to regain its mojo, and the huge demand for AI computing power should ensure that it keeps growing at a terrific pace in the long run.\n\nThe case for Nebius\n\nJust like CoreWeave, even Nebius is getting massive contracts from customers such as Microsoft and Meta. Though Nebius is a relatively small company when compared to CoreWeave, it can scale up quickly thanks to its recent deals.\n\nThe company's Q3 revenue was up by a whopping 355% year over year to $146 million. The multibillion-dollar contracts that Nebius has signed of late suggest that its remarkable growth is sustainable. Microsoft awarded a deal worth $17.4 billion to $19.4 billion to Nebius in September to purchase AI compute capacity from the latter over a five-year period.\n\nMeta has also joined the company's client list with a five-year contract valued at $3 billion. Nebius, therefore, is sitting on a revenue backlog of more than $20 billion. Fortunately, Nebius is now going to boost its data center capacity at a faster pace.\n\nThe company was earlier expecting to have 1 GW of contracted data center capacity at its disposal by the end of 2026. It has now bumped up that target to 2.5 GW. Even better, Nebius plans on boosting its active data center capacity from an estimated 220 MW at the end of 2025 to a range of 800 MW to 1 GW by the end of next year.\n\nSo there is a good chance of Nebius clocking much faster growth in revenue going forward, and that's what even analysts are expecting from the company.\n\nThe verdict\n\nClearly, both CoreWeave and Nebius are high-growth companies that can help investors capitalize on the AI infrastructure boom. However, when it comes to choosing one of these stocks, there is a clear winner.\n\nCoreWeave stock trades at a significantly cheaper sales multiple right now. In fact, it can be bought at a discount to the U.S. technology sector's average price-to-sales ratio of 8.4, despite its stunning growth. Moreover, CoreWeave has a more diversified customer base and a much bigger backlog, while much of Nebius' growth is currently dependent on just two customers.\n\nOf course, even Nebius can turn out to be a solid investment in the long run, but if you're looking to choose from one of these two neocloud companies right now, CoreWeave looks like a better buy from a valuation standpoint.\n\nShould you buy stock in CoreWeave right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CoreWeave, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and CoreWeave wasn’t one of them.

         "Who’s game to take on Big Noise? Sure, it’s retail politics but such obvious retail politics that it’s a wonder our governments haven’t been game to act on behalf of civilised society. Michael Pascoe offers a solution:\n\nIn the admirable cause of keeping the peace, my Sydney neighbours are legally forbidden on the weekend from firing up their Victas after 8 pm or before 8 am. The lawn mowing curfew ends at 7 am on weekdays.\n\nOther neighbours are required to turn down the music and TV at 10 pm Sunday to Thursday and midnight Friday and Saturday. It is not to be heard inside my home.\n\nOn the other hand, a couple of blocks away from me, the bloke who has an engine from a 747 on two wheels and a megaphone instead of a muffler is free to ride the streets at any time he fancies, rattling windows, waking kiddies and causing possums to fall from the trees. (OK, maybe not the possums, but the rest of it.)\n\nThen there are the drug dealers, property developers and nepo babies (who else spends the thick end of a million on a supercar?) furiously compensating for personal inadequacy by revving the rivets out of their machines at traffic lights and between speed bumps, displaying not horsepower but the screech of a thousand cats being skinned alive. Not a problem, boys, you go for it.\n\nLook at me\n\nOf course you don’t need a Ferrari to shatter the night. Most of the screamers and roarers are far from it; their drivers just share the same desperate need to be noticed. “Look at me! I have machine that makes noise! That means I’m, I’m, I’m, er, something!”\n\nFair bet as school children they were the class clowns proud of loud farts. That would fit with the mentality of those with road cars pointlessly tuned to backfire, barking/farting their way to a stop.\n\nTime to resurrect the 2007 NSW anti-speeding ad, “No one thinks big of you” with the young woman now wagging her pinky at motor farters.\n\nHilariously, it is specifically against the law for Ronnie Revhead to use “a vehicle on residential premises (other than for entering or leaving) that can be heard inside a neighbour’s residence, between 8 pm and 8 am on a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday or between 8 pm and 7 am on any other day”.\n\nOnce Ron has his WRX on the street though, BYO ear plugs 24/7.\n\nYou recognise these characters and want more? Try the motorbikes merely very noisy individually but delighting in pack rides through city and suburban streets. Multiply “merely very noisy” by 20 and you can experience life smack up against the airport’s chain link fence with an A380 overhead.\n\nLaws not enforced\n\nSurely there are laws against obnoxious vehicle noise, you might think. Well, yes, and no, and up to a point, Minister.\n\nThere’s Protection of the Environment Operations (Noise Control) Regulation 2017, for example, with all manner of particular offences, but the rules and tests are fiddly and laws are not really laws if they are not enforced.\n\nYou are free to report noisy vehicles in NSW and in the 12 months to April 30 last year, there were indeed 4,455 such reports. And there were exactly zero penalties issued by police.\n\nOver the previous five years there were 34,195 reports – and just 74 penalties issued.\n\nIt looks like the public received the message. Reporting is futile so fewer reports were made and even fewer penalties issued. Noisy vehicles are not a priority for the authorities. (I suspect a fair percentage of those earlier 74 penalties weren’t just about noise, either.)\n\nSleep murderers\n\nIn fairness to the police, catching the needlessly, annoyingly, stupidly revving tool isn’t easy.\n\nA noisy midnight party doesn’t move. It will wait for the police to arrive to deal with it after being reported.\n\nDriven normally and when and if any authority wants to test it, the V6 internal combustion engine of a particular Italian work of art I greatly admire is not at all antisocial, but if a goose wanted to be a goose, as a goose will, not only Macbeth does murder sleep.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be like this. In a crowded city, heck, in any city, nobody needs excessive, completely unnecessary noise, especially in the wee small hours.\n\nOther great cities – New York, London, Paris – already have a partial solution: noise cameras. Just as speed cameras catch the speedster in the act, noise cameras catch the screamers, barkers and roarers when they’re screaming, barking and roaring.\n\nThe NSW Environmental Protection Agency is nearing the end of a 12-month trial of three such devices in the Bayside and Wollongong council areas.\n\nThat is more than Google tells me any other state is doing, but it takes 12 months? And then of course there will have to be careful assessment of the data before bureaucratic wheels move to move political wheels, if they are interested in moving and aren’t quietly owned by the anti-muffler lobby. There are no policy turbochargers here. Don’t retire your earplugs or put off double glazing.\n\nFor this sufferer of midnight road roar, more than enough was known by the trial’s half-way mark to justify wide use of the cameras.\n\nEPA trials\n\nIn response to my enquiry, a spokesperson from the EPA said that by June the trial cameras had detected 2,500 “noise events”.\n\n“A ‘noise event’ can be triggered by any loud noise source,” the spokesperson’s statement stated. “This includes a noisy car or motorbike but can also include thunder or garbage trucks. The EPA analyses each event to confirm its source.”\n\n(Good idea. Hard to book either God or the BoM for thunder.)\n\nThe EPA said further data and analysis was needed before it drew conclusions but it did have some preliminary insights, to wit:\n\nThere are certain days and times when noisy vehicles and driving behaviour increase. Night times and weekends produce the most noise events currently.\n\nMotorcycles are responsible for a majority of noisy events recorded so far in the trial, yet only make up around 4% of all registered motor vehicles, according to Transport for NSW data.\n\nA significant proportion of noise events are from repeat offenders.\n\nThat tells you all you really need to know and anyone with ears in prime locations already knew it.\n\nThe EPA is keeping the locations of the test cameras secret so as to not influence drivers’ behaviour during the trial. May we please start using them for enforcement and keep locations secret and mobile to absolutely influence drivers’ and riders’ behaviour everywhere.\n\nTrial bikes\n\nThe motorcycle finding raises a further question: why should we permit excessively noisy bikes on our roads in the first place? Or at least impose a curfew on them, as we do on motor mowers.\n\nPowerful bikes don’t need to be screamers. It’s only the sirens on police motorcycles that make a lot of noise.\n\nTrail bikes you can hear coming from the other side of a thousand-acre paddock have no place on city streets, particularly at night. Whatever that machine is a couple of blocks away, shut it.\n\nOn top of the excessive danger they pose to riders – every rider knows that at some stage they will put it down, just hopefully not in the path of a bus – and therefore costs to society, the powered two-wheelers don’t need to make a nuisance of themselves with excessive noise.\n\nYou want to play hospital roulette while commuting on two wheels, buy an electric bike instead.\n\nAnd I write as someone who is yet to go the EV route, who loves his internal combustion engine cars, enjoys the sound of a fine engine going through the gears and has no problem with the deep base of a Harley ridden reasonably.\n\nBut there is no reason other than political lack of will and tardiness for innocent bystanders at outdoor cafes and in their homes at night being persecuted by the aforementioned inadequates.\n\nBring on the noise cameras, now!"

The stocks listed below check off those boxes and can make for ideal investments to buy and hold. Not only do they offer high yields today, but they've also been growing their payouts for decades.\n\nAbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), Home Depot (NYSE: HD), and ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) can diversify your portfolio while also setting you up to generate plenty of recurring cash flow for the long term. Here's a closer look at them, and why they're among the best dividend stocks you can buy today.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nAbbVie\n\nPharma stock AbbVie pays investors a yield of around 2.9% right now, which is more than double the S&P 500 average of 1.2%. The company spun off from Abbott Laboratories back in 2013, and when including its streak as part of that business, it spans more than 50 straight years, which means AbbVie is a Dividend King.\n\nThe company's most recent increase is a 5.5% boost to its payout in light of its strong financial results. Since splitting off from Abbott Labs, AbbVie has increased its quarterly dividend payments by over 330%. AbbVie hasn't simply been boosting the dividend to keep its streak going; it has been making meaningful rate hikes for its shareholders.\n\nThrough the first nine months of the year, the company has demonstrated strong growth with sales rising by 8%, to $44.5 billion. Humira is no longer its top-selling drug, but AbbVie has been able to pivot to other drugs, with Skyrizi and Rinvoq generating a combined $18.5 billion through the first three quarters, well above Humira's current quarterly tally of $3.3 billion.\n\nWith a diverse mix of drugs treating various diseases and conditions, AbbVie is one of the most robust and safest dividend stocks you can find in the healthcare sector.\n\nHome Depot\n\nHome improvement giant Home Depot is another top dividend growth stock to buy and hold. While it may not have the impressive growth streak that AbbVie has going, it has been raising its dividend for 16 straight years. And since 2020, its quarterly dividend has grown by more than 50%.\n\nIt's currently yielding 2.7%, which is a solid rate for the retailer. The business is facing challenges as discretionary spending has been down amid challenging economic conditions. But what's encouraging is that the company still expects sales growth of 3% for its current fiscal year (it ends in January)."

A first mover in this space was Beyond Meat (NASDAQ: BYND), which debuted on the stock market in May 2019 at $25 per share only to surge to nearly $67 on its first day of trading.\n\nBy November of the following year, the stock had doubled to more than $140 per share. Unfortunately, if you'd invested $100 in Beyond Meat at that time, you'd be sitting on a position worth ... $0.72 as of this writing. You'd have lost more than 99% of your investment over the past five years. Yikes!\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat happened with Beyond Meat? A glance at its latest earnings report offers some insight: Revenue declined 13% year over year to $70.2 million, and its gross margin shrank 7.4 percentage points to 10.3%. Its net loss was $110.7 million. Excluding non-cash impairment charges and other one-off items, the company still saw a net loss of $29.5 million. Put simply, the company is not firing on all cylinders -- or perhaps any cylinders.\n\nAs Motley Fool contributor Timothy Green recently pointed out, the company continues to suffer from soft demand for its products, and in the face of rising competition, it hasn't been able to make its products stand out enough to warrant premium prices.\n\nWith shares down 73% year to date, you may be wondering if the stock is now undervalued, making it a good buy. Its price-to-sales ratio is just 0.26, after all. However, low valuation multiples don't always point to bargains. In this case, Beyond Meat looks more like a value trap than a value play.\n\nSo if you find yourself with heavy losses in Beyond Meat, there are few signs a successful turnaround is taking shape. You may be better off taking the loss this year and putting what money you have remaining in a truly exciting and promising stock.\n\nShould you buy stock in Beyond Meat right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Beyond Meat, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Beyond Meat wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $580,171!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,084,986!*"

         "Sales on Black Friday rose from a year earlier, according to a key data provider — a sign that US consumers are continuing to spend despite persistent economic concerns.\n\nRetail sales, excluding autos, increased 4.1% on the day after Thanksgiving, according to data from Mastercard SpendingPulse. That surpasses last year’s 3.4% growth. The figures, which are not adjusted for inflation, draw from both online and in-person purchases to give a broad view of economic activity.\n\nThe data shows US shoppers’ resilience amid higher costs and job-market concerns. To appeal to price-sensitive consumers, retailers are offering discounts on a wide range of goods — although the promotions may not be quite as deep as in past years. Companies are also highlighting newer, exclusive items for the season, ranging from $10 couch throws to $5 Barbie dolls.\n\nThe holiday season is a key barometer for consumer demand, with executives, economists and investors closely watching households’ spending habits. While shoppers tend to splurge at the end of the year on gifts, trends have started to shift and higher costs across the economy have fueled concern that consumers will buy fewer items.\n\nIn-store sales rose 1.7%, above last year’s pace. Online sales rose 10.4%, lower than last year’s gain.\n\n“It clearly shows that the consumer has the ability to spend,” Michelle Meyer, chief economist at the Mastercard Economics Institute, said in an interview.\n\nDespite macroeconomic swings, shoppers appear to have purchasing power and were spending at a consistent level heading into Black Friday. Still, the outlook for the rest of the shopping period remains in flux — including how much of the sales growth is driven by inflation versus units and to what extent people open up their wallets through the end of the year, she said.\n\nOn Black Friday, retailers catering to teens and 20-somethings were standouts that drew heavy traffic. Stores offering large discounts also attracted big crowds. Walmart Inc. said Vizio TVs, Oura rings and seasonal toys were popular items and shoppers were looking to maximize deals. Holiday decor and tools sold well at Home Depot Inc.\n\nStill, many shoppers said deals seemed more muted compared with last year, at least initially. Retailers are offering gifts to appeal to cautious consumers. Target Corp. said, on average, 150 shoppers waited at opening time for free giveaways.\n\nWhile preliminary data on retail performance will be released in the coming weeks, definitive information on companies’ performance won’t be available until early 2026.\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P."

         "Key Points\n\nBuffett and his investing team are never afraid to wade into new sectors.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean they are undisciplined and will buy stocks at monster valuations.\n\nIn addition to artificial intelligence, many of the AI stocks Berkshire buys also run other strong business lines.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nOne thing I've always admired about Warren Buffett, outgoing CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, is that throughout his remarkable career, he has consistently adhered to his core investing principles without becoming entrenched in his old ways. Buffett and his team have never been afraid to invest in newer sectors.\n\nWhile Berkshire isn't buying pure artificial intelligence stocks, the company (at the direction of Buffett) has purchased several stocks in the \"Magnificent Seven\" during a time when many investors are concerned about the sheer size of these companies and their dominance of the broader market. In fact, nearly 24% of Berkshire's massive, roughly $305 billion equities portfolio is invested in just these three stocks.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Apple: 21.3%\n\nBerkshire first invested in consumer tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in 2016 and at one point had grown the position to roughly 40% of Berkshire's portfolio. Buffett supposedly first got interested in the position after seeing how devastated one of his friends was after losing their iPhone.\n\nApple has many of the characteristics that Buffett typically looks for in a stock: a rock-solid moat, a strong brand, tremendous earnings power, and it has repurchased a lot of stock over the years.\n\nWhile a part of the Magnificent Seven, many investors have been concerned about Apple's AI strategy. But at some point, the company is likely to become a tremendous beneficiary of the technology, at the very least as it integrates AI features into its consumer products.\n\nWhile Apple is still Berkshire's largest position, Berkshire has sold 74% of its stake in the company since early 2023. Buffett and Berkshire have seemingly been very worried about the market, so it makes sense they would want to reduce their exposure to one of the biggest stocks in the market. I think it's likely Berkshire will eventually exit the position.\n\nApple has actually proven to be a decent stock to own during the AI sell-off because it hasn't invested as heavily in AI infrastructure as some of its peers, making those worried about a bubble less concerned with the company. I believe it's a stock that investors can still hold for the long term.\n\n2. Alphabet: 1.8%\n\nBerkshire initiated a new position in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) during the third quarter, a stock that seemed to be a popular pick among hedge funds. Google has had a bumpy year, but ultimately seems to have emerged better. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) sued the large tech conglomerate, alleging that Google employed monopolistic practices in the search and digital advertising markets to maintain its dominant position."
