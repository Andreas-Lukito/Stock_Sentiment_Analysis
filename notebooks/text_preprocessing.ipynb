Europe's Stoxx 600 managed to hold onto gains, making November the fifth positive month in a row. But tech stocks also suffered, as concerns over AI valuations and spending plans played out across global stock markets. So what does this mean for December — can stocks stage a seasonal Santa Rally, or will it be more 'bah humbug' in the final trading month of the year?\n\nMacy's Santa Claus is greeted by traders on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., Nov. 26, 2025. Brendan Mcdermid | Reuters\n\nThe case for a Santa Rally\n\nFidelity International crunched the numbers: The FTSE 100 has delivered a positive return during December in 24 out of the last 30 years. There could be some festive cheer for the U.K. this year, with markets pricing in a 90% chance the Bank of England will cut the interest rate in December after the budget was seen as avoiding any seriously inflationary measures. It's a different picture for the European Central Bank, where markets see zero chance of a cut, but this is also seen as a positive sign as the governing council said policy is in a \"good place\" in their last set of minutes. European and Asian stocks have tracked the U.S. higher each time expectations rise for a cut at the next Federal Reserve meeting in December, with a near-83% chance of a reduction now expected by markets, according to CME Fedwatch. The central banks could help bring the festive spirit this December.\n\nThe 'bah humbug' case\n\nBut there are market forces that could leave the bulls finding a lump of coal in their stocking. The drivers behind the volatility in November have not magically disappeared, with some investors and market watchers still voicing concern over the pace of AI hyperscaler spending. Even the ECB made the usual move this week of warning that U.S. tech valuations are stretched because investors have FOMO, \"fear of missing out.\" The central bank warned of \"sharp correlated price adjustments\" as a key risk for AI-driven stocks.\n\nwatch now\n\nCrypto could also be a drag in the final month of the year. As CNBC reported last week, Compass Point predicts bitcoin will continue declining as newer investors sell the token and exchange-traded-funds tied to it. Compass also suggests long-term holders could sell down their holdings due to the \"halving\" schedule, which happens every four years and \"programmatically cuts in half the amount of rewards individuals get for mining new tokens on the bitcoin blockchain.\" Why the pressure on bitcoin may linger into year-end Whether you believe in the Santa Rally or not, December will cap a fascinating year for asset classes across the globe, and make 2026 predictions tough to call.\n\nGlobal events in December:"

         "And just like that... December is upon us. It's been a volatile handover from November with U.S. major indices underperforming, dragged down by steep declines for the Nasdaq. Europe's Stoxx 600 managed to hold onto gains, making November the fifth positive month in a row. But tech stocks also suffered, as concerns over AI valuations and spending plans played out across global stock markets. So what does this mean for December — can stocks stage a seasonal Santa Rally, or will it be more 'bah humbug' in the final trading month of the year?\n\nMacy's Santa Claus is greeted by traders on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., Nov. 26, 2025. Brendan Mcdermid | Reuters\n\nThe case for a Santa Rally\n\nFidelity International crunched the numbers: The FTSE 100 has delivered a positive return during December in 24 out of the last 30 years. There could be some festive cheer for the U.K. this year, with markets pricing in a 90% chance the Bank of England will cut the interest rate in December after the budget was seen as avoiding any seriously inflationary measures. It's a different picture for the European Central Bank, where markets see zero chance of a cut, but this is also seen as a positive sign as the governing council said policy is in a \"good place\" in their last set of minutes. European and Asian stocks have tracked the U.S. higher each time expectations rise for a cut at the next Federal Reserve meeting in December, with a near-83% chance of a reduction now expected by markets, according to CME Fedwatch. The central banks could help bring the festive spirit this December.\n\nThe 'bah humbug' case\n\nBut there are market forces that could leave the bulls finding a lump of coal in their stocking. The drivers behind the volatility in November have not magically disappeared, with some investors and market watchers still voicing concern over the pace of AI hyperscaler spending. Even the ECB made the usual move this week of warning that U.S. tech valuations are stretched because investors have FOMO, \"fear of missing out.\" The central bank warned of \"sharp correlated price adjustments\" as a key risk for AI-driven stocks.\n\nwatch now\n\nCrypto could also be a drag in the final month of the year. As CNBC reported last week, Compass Point predicts bitcoin will continue declining as newer investors sell the token and exchange-traded-funds tied to it. Compass also suggests long-term holders could sell down their holdings due to the \"halving\" schedule, which happens every four years and \"programmatically cuts in half the amount of rewards individuals get for mining new tokens on the bitcoin blockchain.\" Why the pressure on bitcoin may linger into year-end Whether you believe in the Santa Rally or not, December will cap a fascinating year for asset classes across the globe, and make 2026 predictions tough to call.\n\nGlobal events in December:"

U.S. equities posted broad gains in a holiday-shortened week, supported by softer economic data and dovish messaging from Federal Reserve officials. The markets have priced an 86% probability of a 25 bps rate cut by the Fed at its December 10th meeting. Small caps outpaced large caps, and technology shares rebounded strongly.\n\nThe standout move came from silver, which surged 13%, a move reflecting both inflation concerns and increased demand for safe-haven or alternative assets.\n\nEuropean markets also strengthened, with a notable rally in bank stocks. Meanwhile, volatility dropped substantially, creating a supportive backdrop for equities and credit.\n\nUNITED STATES\n\nEquities & Markets\n\nMajor indices posted weekly gains: Dow: +3.18% S&P 500: +3.73% Nasdaq: +4.91%\n\nThe Russell 2000, a gauge of smaller companies, rose 5.52%, reflecting a shift toward risk-on sentiment.\n\nEconomic Data\n\nRetail sales: +0.2% for September, below expectations.\n\n+0.2% for September, below expectations.

Consumer confidence: Fell to 88.7, signaling growing economic caution.\n\nPolicy & Rates\n\nFed Beige Book: Employment edged lower. Prices continued moderate increases. Consumer spending weakened further.\n\nTreasury market: Yields fell as investors priced in a likely December rate cut.

Germany’s business sentiment weakened, while consumer willingness to buy improved.\n\nJAPAN\n\nJapanese markets rallied strongly:\n\nNikkei: +3.35%\n\nTOPIX: +2.45%\n\nMomentum was fueled by dovish signals about global monetary policy, a rebound in tech/AI shares, and steady Tokyo inflation at 2.8%, reinforcing speculation that the Bank of Japan may contemplate a future rate hike.\n\nThe 10-year JGB yield rose to 1.82%, approaching levels last seen 17 years ago.\n\nCHINA\n\nChinese equity benchmarks advanced:\n\nCSI 300: +1.64%\n\nShanghai Composite: +1.40%\n\nHang Seng: +2.53%\n\nDespite these gains, industrial profits fell 5.5% year over year, indicating slowing momentum and highlighting persistent structural challenges—particularly within manufacturing and real estate.\n\nOTHER KEY MARKETS/GEOPOLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nRussia–Ukraine Peace Framework Discussions\n\nA 28-point U.S. proposal has gained traction among NATO and EU members, offering a potential basis for negotiations but still requiring major concessions from both sides.\n\nSouth Korea Monetary Policy\n\nThe Bank of Korea kept the Base Rate at 2.50%, noting rising inflation but maintaining flexibility for future cuts amid global uncertainty.\n\nMARKET VOLATILITY TRENDS\n\nThe VIX dropped sharply to 16, falling 7 points in one week.\n\nThis move signals:\n\nDeclining hedging costs\n\nRenewed appetite for equities and credit\n\nPossible overconfidence if economic data fails to stabilize\n\nThe drop in volatility was one of the most influential forces shaping global risk sentiment the past and upcoming week.\n\nPRECIOUS METALS: SILVER’S POWERFUL SURGE\n\nSilver’s 13% weekly rally has pushed its year-to-date gain beyond 90%, dramatically surpassing Bitcoin’s –3% performance.\n\nKey catalysts include:\n\nStrong industrial demand\n\nElevated geopolitical tensions\n\nA softer U.S. dollar\n\nGrowing investor preference for tangible, inflation-resistant assets\n\nEUROPEAN FINANCIAL SECTOR: BANKS BREAK OUT\n\n\n\nEurozone banks delivered another standout performance this week.\n\nTheir strong gains reflect:\n\nStabilizing macroeconomic conditions\n\nAttractive valuations\n\nPositive earnings momentum\n\nEnhanced foreign interest due to currency strength\n\nThis sector remains a cornerstone of the European equity story in 2024.\n\nOUTLOOK: WHAT TO WATCH NEXT"
